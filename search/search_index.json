Brain biopsy may be indicated if diagnostic uncertainty. Management: Pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin is the preferred regimen, discuss dosing with pharmacy. Alternative regimens: clindamycin, Bactrim, atovaquone, and/or azithromycin. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) Presentation: chronic (weeks to months), progressive neurologic dysfunction, particularly incoordination and other motor dysfunction, aphasia, sometimes cognitive impairment and personality changes Evaluation: MRI brain w/patchy areas of demyelination in the subcortical white matter; location is variable, but p arietal, occipital, and cerebellar involvement are common. JC virus PCR from CSF. Brain biopsy (uncommonly done) Management: Initiation of ART may slow/stop progression. Fatal if HIV goes untreated. HIV-related encephalopathy Presentation: Similar to other progressive dementias, with short term memory loss followed by worsening global cognitive dysfunction, motor deficits, sometimes seizures in late stages Evaluation: MRI w/diffuse cerebral atrophy and/or demyelinating lesions similar to PML. CSF w/elevated protein \u00b1 lymphocytic pleocytosis, with no alternative cause. Send HIV RNA from the CSF, usually + in HIV encephalopathy Cryptococcal meningitis Presentation: Subacute to chronically worsening HA and fevers; meningismus and photophobia may be present but are often absent; rarely, focal neurologic deficits Evaluation: LP to check opening pressure and can send serum and CSF Cryptococcus Ag. Brain imaging may be non-diagnostic Treatment: Induction therapy with amphotericin and flucytosine x14 days (at least), with repeat LP close to end of induction to confirm CSF inflammation is improving and fungal culture is negative. Maintenance therapy consists of high dose fluconazole for at least 8 weeks. Pts may require serial LP to manage ICP Delay ART for several weeks after start of treatment to avoid risk of IRIS. CMV retinitis (with vision loss) Presentation: Blurry vision, focal blind spots, visual field deficits, or scotomas and floaters. Typically begins unilateral, though often progresses to bilateral involvement. Evaluation: Always consult ophtho if you suspect it! Hemorrhagic retinitis, \u201ctomato soup and milk\u201d appearance on dilated exam. May cause complete retinal detachment. Check CMV pcr serum (or vitreous) Management: PO valgancyclovir (+intravitreous ganciclovir or foscarnet in severe disease). If not on ART, must delay ART for at least 2 weeks after start of CMV retinitis treatment to prevent immune recovery uveitis Pulmonary Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) Presentation: fever, shortness of breath, cough (usually non-productive), sometimes night sweats and weight loss. Hypoxia out of proportion to exam. Evaluation: CT chest appearance usually bilateral and diffuse with GGOs and cystic lesions of varying size. Large cysts can rupture, causing pneumothorax. Induced sputum (or bronchoscopy sample) with cytology and GMS stain. Send serum LDH and 1,3-BD-glucan: should be elevated, but are nonspecific. Management: Bactrim is the preferred treatment; PO is preferable as Bactrim is 100% bioavailable. **If patient is hypoxic, need to consider of adding steroids, can measure A-a gradient. Alternative regimens may include primaquine + clindamycin or IV (NOT inhaled) pentamidine. Pulmonary tuberculosis Presentation: With low CD4, can have upper lobe cavities but also atypical radiographic pattern, including a normal-appearing CXR. Have a high degree of suspicion in any patient with advanced HIV and respiratory complaints. Evaluation: TB skin tests and IGRAs have a high false negative rate in advanced HIV. At VUMC, any pt with HIV and respiratory complaints must be placed on airborne until TB ruleout- 3 sputum mycobacterial cultures collected at least 8 hours apart. If concentrated smear is negative x3, TB is unlikely (though have to follow up final culture to be sure). Management: RIPE therapy is the standard initial treatment, with adjustment if needed for drug resistance or contraindications Herpes simplex tracheobronchitis and/or pneumonitis/pneumonia Evaluation: bronchoscopy with positive HSV PCR from BAL \u00b1 lung biopsy. (Usually associated with HSV-1) Management: agent and duration not well defined for bronchopulmonary disease; depending on severity of presentation, likely IV acyclovir to start followed by transition to PO antiviral once evidence of clinical improvement, for a total of 10-14 days. Recurrent pneumonia NOS Histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, coccidiomycosis, and non-TB mycobacterial infections (including MAC) limited to the pulmonary system are not AIDs defining illnesses, though pts with advanced HIV and other severely immunosuppressed states are at higher risk. Gastrointestinal Esophageal candidiasis Presentation: Dysphagia, odynophagia or both. Concurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis (\u201cthrush\u2019) is common but not universal. Evaluation: Typically presumptive. Treatment is the test; start fluconazole and consider EGD if symptoms do not improve after several days (in which case candidiasis may be severe, or it might not be the cause) Management: Fluconazole; nystatin is ineffective, especially in the severely immunocompromised Herpes simplex esophagitis Evaluation: EGD shows diffuse ulcerations throughout the esophagus; in severe disease ulcers may coalesce into dark patches, \u201cblack esophagus.\u201d Esophageal biopsy is definitive, but can infer based on EGD appearance and serum studies. Management: Similar to other mucocutaneous infections, consider IV acyclovir at first and transition to PO once clinically improved CMV esophagitis/enteritis/colitis Presentation: GI bleeding (colitis) or dysphagia and odynophagia (esophagitis) Evaluation: serum CMV PCR, consult GI for consideration of EGD/colonoscopy Management: (val)ganciclovir, foscarnet if ganciclovir resistance or contraindication Chronic (>1 mo) intestinal isosporiasis Evaluation: Stool ova/parasite can capture Iospora belli (new name Cystoisospora belli), may need serial analysis due to intermittent shedding. Oocysts may also be seen on duodenal biopsy. Management: Bactrim; pyrimethamine + leucovorin if Bactrim is contraindicated Chronic intestinal cryptosporidiosis Presentation: Diarrhea; may infect respiratory tract, causing nonproductive cough Evaluation: on GiPP or Cryptosporidium Ag Management: Early initiation or optimization of ART; Monotherapy with nitazoxanide is preferred; raising CD4 count >100 is necessary to cure infection Recurrent salmonella septicemia Generally sensitive to fluoroquinolones, but if not clinically improving as expected you can request sensitivities from the microbiology lab. Neoplastic Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma - Burkitt\u2019s, immunoblastic (subset of DLBCL), and 1\u00ba CNS Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma Presentation: Distinctive mucocutaneous lesions, usually raised, papular, violaceous or darkly colored, non-tender and non-pruritic. Can also involve the visceral organs (esp lungs and GI tract) and deep lymphatic system. Evaluation: clinical, tissue biopsy for staging, HHV-8 serum PCR. Management: Limited mucocutaneous disease may resolve with initiation/optimization of ART, but widespread or resistant disease may require additional local therapies (ex radiation) or systemic chemo Bacillary angiomatosis (caused by Bartonella) may present similarly, but can be distinguished from KS on biopsy. It is neither a cancer nor an AIDS defining clinical condition, and is usually treated with doxycycline. Cervical cancer Presentation, diagnosis, and treatment are essentially the same as in HIV-negative patients, but incidence is higher and disease progression is often more rapid Multisystem/Miscellaneous Extrapulmonary or disseminated Mycobacterial infection (TB and non-TB) TB can go everywhere; some notable extrapulmonary sites include lymph nodes (e.g., scrofula), bones and joints (e.g., Pott\u2019s disease of the spine), pleura and pericardium, GU tract, and CNS. Dx can come from tissue culture and sometimes MTB PCR for more rapid detection (needs ID approval). TB-IRIS may be severe (esp with high infection burden) and hard to distinguish from TB treatment failure; can also be seen in adequately treated TB (provoked by the presence of dead bacteria) and undiagnosed latent TB. Disseminated MAC is usually diagnosed with AFB blood culture (only 1 positive needed). Think about it in patients with uncontrolled HIV and severe immunosuppression (esp CD4 \\<50), with unintentional weight loss, chronic diarrhea and/or dyspnea, and evidence of GI malabsorption or with bone marrow suppression Extrapulmonary or disseminated Histoplasmosis, Cryptococcocosis, and Coccidiodomycosis Can be difficult to distinguish based on clinical presentation and imaging alone.

Evaluation Assessment of urinary symptoms UA + reflex urine Cx (Cx if pt is admitted or has recurrent UTIs) Non -reflex urine Cx: pregnant pts, neutropenia, and pts undergoing urologic procedures Management Empiric therapy Nitrofurantoin monohydrate: 100 mg PO BID x 5 days (avoid if any concern for pyelonephritis or if creatinine clearance \\<60) Cephalexin 250-500mg q6h x5-7 days Alternative therapies Fosfomycin: 3 grams of powder mixed in water as a single PO dose (avoid if any concern for ascending UTI or pyelonephritis). Susceptibility test results must be requested of micro lab and are only possible for E. coli and E. Faecalis. Amoxicillin -clavulanate: 500mg PO BID x5 days Ciprofloxacin : 250mg PO BID x3 days FQ\u2019s should be reserved for more serious infections than uncomplicated cystitis, and only after susceptibility results are confirmed given high rates of resistance from overuse (~25% of E. coli are resistant to ciprofloxacin at VUMC) Adverse effect profile >> beta-lactams (i.e. QT-prolongation, tendinopathies) Additional Information MDR cystitis: ESBL isolates are increasingly common due to antibiotic overuse Before treating, decide if this is a TRUE UTI If true, then for uncomplicated cystitis with ESBL organism, consider Fosfomycin (if E. coli ) or nitrofurantoin (if susceptibility is confirmed \u2013 K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp are usually resistant), or ID consultation Ask the lab to check susceptibility results to these antibiotics, for the future reference Complicated UTI and Pyelonephritis Background Fever , pyuria, and costovertebral angle tenderness suggest pyelonephritis. If any of the following are present, it is also considered a complicated UTI UTI with any of the following present: Renal calculi or other obstructive disease, Immunosuppressed host, abnormal urological anatomy or physiology, presence of a urinary catheter Evaluation UA with reflex urine culture BCx and UCx prior to antibiotics If there is no pyuria, consider an alternative diagnosis, or proximal ureteral obstruction Pyuria is common in the presence of a urinary catheter, kidney stones, urostomy, ileal conduit and other invasive devices, and may not indicate infection Management Duration: 7-14 days, depending on antibiotic choice Follow up culture to confirm clearance, especially if outpatient Tailor therapy once/if cultures are available. If no improvement in 48h, consider imaging to rule out complications (e.g., perinephric abscess) 0 1 2 NaN First Line Alternative Outpatient Ciprofloxacin 750 BID (or 500 BID if bacteremia r/o) x 7d NaN Inpatient - CTX 2g q24h - Cefepime 2g q8h - Meropenem 2g q8h (if h/o or confirmed ESBL w/in last 90 d) - Ertapenem 1g q24 instead of Meropenem if no Pseudomonas - Ciprofloxacin 750 PO BID (500 PO BID if bacteremia ruled out) OR 400 IV BID (if suscept confirmed)* *FQ\u2019s have same bioavailability if given PO or IV so oral is preferred Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) Background Culture growth of > 10 3 cfu/mL of uropathogenic bacteria + signs or symptoms consistent with infection (without another identified etiology) + indwelling urethral/suprapubic catheter or intermittent catheterization. This includes pts with catheters in place during the preceding 48 hours Duration = greatest risk factor (Increases 3-10% per day of catheterization) Other risks: female sex, diabetes, elderly, colonization of catheter bag, poor care Bacteriuria, foul odor, pyuria, urine appearance and/or bacteriuria alone are not indicative of infection in patients who are otherwise asymptomatic. Ensure clean sample collected Ideally, catheter is removed and midstream sample obtained If catheterization required; removal of old catheter and sample taken from new Management Distinguish uncomplicated vs complicated UTI (see above) Antimicrobial management: Guided by cultures and susceptibilities Empiric guidance as per management of uncomplicated/complicated UTI and per prior culture data/susceptibilities when available Duration: 7 \u2013 14 days depending on antibiotic, clinical response and whether infection constitutes complicated vs uncomplicated UTI Special note regarding Candida UTI management: Candida Is generally not pathogenic Presence in urine does not indicate infection (unless perinephric abscess, renal transplant, or complex fistulous disease) Fluconazole achieves excellent urinary penetration Echinocandins do not, and other azoles are not well studied in UTIs If fluconazole resistant Candida cultured or suspected, consult ID Susceptibilities are not routinely run on Candida from urine cultures and would need to be requested if concern for true infection. Catheter management At the least, catheters should be replaced at the time of antibiotic initiation Preferably, catheters should be removed If catheterization is necessary, intermittent catheterization is preferred over continuous use.

CPT Codes: Current Procedural Terminology Codes: Numeric codes assigned to every task and service a physician may provide to a patient including medical, surgical, and diagnostic services. They are used by insurers to determine the amount of reimbursement that a practitioner will receive. E&M Codes: Evaluation and Management Codes. These are a category of CPT codes and are the most frequently used. There are different levels of E&M codes, which are determined by the complexity of a patient visit and documentation requirements. Example: 99204 (new patient, level 4) or 99213 (established patient, level 3). Preventive Service Codes: A category of CPT codes used for annual wellness exams. Example: 99395 (established patient, age 18-40). Problem Oriented Visits Return and new patients for which you are mainly addressing one or more acute or chronic problems should be filed under an E&M code. Documentation for these visits only need to include what you as a physician think is medically appropriate.

They are used by insurers to determine the amount of reimbursement that a practitioner will receive. E&M Codes: Evaluation and Management Codes. These are a category of CPT codes and are the most frequently used. There are different levels of E&M codes, which are determined by the complexity of a patient visit and documentation requirements. Example: 99204 (new patient, level 4) or 99213 (established patient, level 3). Preventive Service Codes: A category of CPT codes used for annual wellness exams. Example: 99395 (established patient, age 18-40). Problem Oriented Visits Return and new patients for which you are mainly addressing one or more acute or chronic problems should be filed under an E&M code. Documentation for these visits only need to include what you as a physician think is medically appropriate. The correct E&M code for the visit will depend on three categories: (1) medical complexity, (2) level of risk with testing/treatment, and (3) the amount/complexity of data reviewed. To meet criteria for a given code, the visit must meet the criteria in at least 2 of the 3 aforementioned categories. 0 1 2 Code 99213 (Established) or 99203 (New) - you will sometimes have a level 3 visit when addressing only one problem or providing no prescriptions Code 99213 (Established) or 99203 (New) -

Biopsychosocial factors must be addressed. Examples include anxiety/depression, physical debility, and poor social support. Many pts will not be completely free of pain, so it is important to set realistic boundaries and goals along with each individual. Central sensitization is a phenomenon where the nervous system persists in a state of high reactivity which lowers the threshold for pain stimuli. Two characteristics of centralized pain are allodynia (pain from non-painful stimuli) and hyperalgesia (painful stimuli perceived as more painful). You must ask \u201cwhy does this particular patient have pain?\u201d Cancer patient vs degenerative disc disease will have different therapeutic plans. Pharmacologic Therapy Acetaminophen : 650mg q6hr or 1g q8h. \\<3g/day. (\\<2g in liver patients) Avoid if you are worried about masking fevers. NSAIDs : A great option for acute pain, especially musculoskeletal, HA, and nephrolithiasis in eligible patients (ex: IV/po ketorolac, ibuprofen, naproxen, etc) Avoid in acute or chronic kidney disease and \u2191 risk of bleeding. Caution in CAD/PVD Topical Analgesics Best for localized pain but utilized frequently as part of a multimodal regimen Lidocaine ointment, patches (PADR needed at VA for patches. Can get by saying contraindication to TCA/gabapentinoids/SNRIs due to sedation risk) Menthol salicylate gel Diclofenac Gel (PADR needed at VA) Capsaicin gel Morphine gel (typically limited to oncology patients with tumor breakdown through skin) Neuropathic Agents : Best for neuropathic pain but can be tried for other chronic pain or as part of acute pain regimen. SNRIs and TCAs can provide additional benefit if a pt has comorbid depression, anxiety or insomnia (TCA). Most agents take 6-8 weeks for peak effect. Gabapentin (Initial: 100 to 300 mg 1 to 3 times daily). Can be used for acute pain. Pregabalin (Initial: 25 to 150 mg/day in 2 to 3 divided doses). Has better bioavailability. May work in patients who did not tolerate or did not have success with gabapentin. Duloxetine ( Initial: 30 mg daily for 1 to 2 weeks, then increase to 60 mg daily as tolerated) Amitriptyline ( Initial: 10 to 25 mg once daily at bedtime) Muscle Relaxants : Should be used temporarily and intermittently but some benefit from longer term use. Great for paraplegia, spinal injury, spasticity. Methocarbamol (Initial: 1.5 g 3 to 4 times daily for 2 to 3 days then decrease dose to \u22644.5 g/day in 3 to 4 divided doses). Preferred initial agent as has least SE. Tizanidine ( Initial: 2 to 4 mg every 6 to 12 hours as needed and/or at bedtime ) \u2013 important to watch out for withdrawal in patients that take frequently at home. Cyclobenzaprine (Initial: 5 to 10 mg once daily before bedtime) Metaxalone (Oral: 800 mg 3 to 4 times daily) Opioids: Frequently used in hospital for acute pain. Limit use as much as possible in chronic pain as contributes to long-term central sensitization. May benefit some patient populations but should always be used as a component of a comprehensive, multimodal, patient-specific treatment plan. Refer to section under Opioids: General Principles & Conversions for OME equivalents If > 80 OME per day, ensure patient is prescribed naloxone If >120 OME per day, refer to pain clinic Common choices for acute pain in hospital (always start at low end for opioid na\u00efve): Oxycodone (PO) 5-10mg q4 to 6 hours prn Hydromorphone (IV) 0.25 to 1mg q2 to 3 hours prn For pts on opioids at home, should always continue in hospital to avoid withdrawal unless clinically contraindicated (e.g., respiratory depression). Can always titrate dose as needed Tramadol : Has opioid & NSAID properties. Of note, tramadol also inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 so there is variability between patients. Typical dose: 25 to 50mg q4 to 6 hours prn. NMDA Antagonists Usually prescribed by our pain management colleagues but worthwhile to think about as a potential option if a patient\u2019s pain continues to be difficult to control. Ketamine (IV infusion). SE includes AMS/delirium, hallucinations, and dissociation. Memantine (PO) Alpha 2 agonists (central pain) Not commonly utilized in everyday practice, but helpful in certain patients with chronic pain (off-label). Guanfacine vs clonidine Non-pharmacologic therapies Procedural Intervention Best utilized when there is a specific, targetable Referral to chronic/interventional pain management (Nerve blocks or Radio-ablative therapy) Adjunct Therapies Patient\u2019s will have varying opinions and responses on adjunctive therapies, but these can be as important as any pharmacologic therapy. CBT, personalized exercise regimen, PT/OT, chiropractor, acupuncture Additional Resources for Residents Pain Management Center at VUMC Pain Clinic at the VA. Would specify whether or not you are OK with them initiating opioids. Osher Center for Integrative Health at Vanderbilt. (VA pts may utilize this service if they have private insurance) Acute pain for special populations Renal dysfunction Check meds are renally dosed and start with non-sedating options. Always avoid NSAIDs, morphine and codeine. Acetaminophen and topicals are safe. Opioids: oxycodone 2.5 to 5 mg, IV dilaudid 0.25-0.5mg, fentanyl IV 25 to 50mcg Gabapentin: start with spot 100mg. Be extremely careful with quick uptitration in CKD due to sedation risk.

Biopsychosocial factors must be addressed. Examples include anxiety/depression, physical debility, and poor social support. Many pts will not be completely free of pain, so it is important to set realistic boundaries and goals along with each individual. Central sensitization is a phenomenon where the nervous system persists in a state of high reactivity which lowers the threshold for pain stimuli. Two characteristics of centralized pain are allodynia (pain from non-painful stimuli) and hyperalgesia (painful stimuli perceived as more painful). You must ask \u201cwhy does this particular patient have pain?\u201d Cancer patient vs degenerative disc disease will have different therapeutic plans. Pharmacologic Therapy Acetaminophen : 650mg q6hr or 1g q8h. \\<3g/day. (\\<2g in liver patients) Avoid if you are worried about masking fevers. NSAIDs : A great option for acute pain, especially musculoskeletal, HA, and nephrolithiasis in eligible patients (ex: IV/po ketorolac, ibuprofen, naproxen, etc) Avoid in acute or chronic kidney disease and \u2191 risk of bleeding. Caution in CAD/PVD Topical Analgesics Best for localized pain but utilized frequently as part of a multimodal regimen Lidocaine ointment, patches (PADR needed at VA for patches. Can get by saying contraindication to TCA/gabapentinoids/SNRIs due to sedation risk) Menthol salicylate gel Diclofenac Gel (PADR needed at VA) Capsaicin gel Morphine gel (typically limited to oncology patients with tumor breakdown through skin) Neuropathic Agents : Best for neuropathic pain but can be tried for other chronic pain or as part of acute pain regimen. SNRIs and TCAs can provide additional benefit if a pt has comorbid depression, anxiety or insomnia (TCA). Most agents take 6-8 weeks for peak effect. Gabapentin (Initial: 100 to 300 mg 1 to 3 times daily). Can be used for acute pain. Pregabalin (Initial: 25 to 150 mg/day in 2 to 3 divided doses). Has better bioavailability. May work in patients who did not tolerate or did not have success with gabapentin. Duloxetine ( Initial: 30 mg daily for 1 to 2 weeks, then increase to 60 mg daily as tolerated) Amitriptyline ( Initial: 10 to 25 mg once daily at bedtime) Muscle Relaxants : Should be used temporarily and intermittently but some benefit from longer term use. Great for paraplegia, spinal injury, spasticity. Methocarbamol (Initial: 1.5 g 3 to 4 times daily for 2 to 3 days then decrease dose to \u22644.5 g/day in 3 to 4 divided doses). Preferred initial agent as has least SE. Tizanidine ( Initial: 2 to 4 mg every 6 to 12 hours as needed and/or at bedtime ) \u2013 important to watch out for withdrawal in patients that take frequently at home. Cyclobenzaprine (Initial: 5 to 10 mg once daily before bedtime) Metaxalone (Oral: 800 mg 3 to 4 times daily) Opioids: Frequently used in hospital for acute pain. Limit use as much as possible in chronic pain as contributes to long-term central sensitization. May benefit some patient populations but should always be used as a component of a comprehensive, multimodal, patient-specific treatment plan. Refer to section under Opioids: General Principles & Conversions for OME equivalents If > 80 OME per day, ensure patient is prescribed naloxone If >120 OME per day, refer to pain clinic Common choices for acute pain in hospital (always start at low end for opioid na\u00efve): Oxycodone (PO) 5-10mg q4 to 6 hours prn Hydromorphone (IV) 0.25 to 1mg q2 to 3 hours prn For pts on opioids at home, should always continue in hospital to avoid withdrawal unless clinically contraindicated (e.g., respiratory depression). Can always titrate dose as needed Tramadol : Has opioid & NSAID properties. Of note, tramadol also inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 so there is variability between patients. Typical dose: 25 to 50mg q4 to 6 hours prn. NMDA Antagonists Usually prescribed by our pain management colleagues but worthwhile to think about as a potential option if a patient\u2019s pain continues to be difficult to control. Ketamine (IV infusion). SE includes AMS/delirium, hallucinations, and dissociation. Memantine (PO) Alpha 2 agonists (central pain) Not commonly utilized in everyday practice, but helpful in certain patients with chronic pain (off-label). Guanfacine vs clonidine Non-pharmacologic therapies Procedural Intervention Best utilized when there is a specific, targetable Referral to chronic/interventional pain management (Nerve blocks or Radio-ablative therapy) Adjunct Therapies Patient\u2019s will have varying opinions and responses on adjunctive therapies, but these can be as important as any pharmacologic therapy.

Would specify whether or not you are OK with them initiating opioids. Osher Center for Integrative Health at Vanderbilt. (VA pts may utilize this service if they have private insurance) Acute pain for special populations Renal dysfunction Check meds are renally dosed and start with non-sedating options. Always avoid NSAIDs, morphine and codeine. Acetaminophen and topicals are safe. Opioids: oxycodone 2.5 to 5 mg, IV dilaudid 0.25-0.5mg, fentanyl IV 25 to 50mcg Gabapentin: start with spot 100mg. Be extremely careful with quick uptitration in CKD due to sedation risk.

Inquire as to which family is present prior to entering, including whether the POA is currently at bedside. Be aware of the circumstances of the patient\u2019s death, particularly whether death was expected or sudden. In general, it is best to enter accompanied, ideally with the patient\u2019s nurse. It is rare for the chaplain to be present but that might also be a consideration. Inquire with the nurse if Tennessee Donor Services (TDS) has been notified; often, when death is anticipated, the nurse will already have done this, although that is not always the case. Remember that it is not your position/role to approach the family regarding organ donation, but TDS should have been notified and there should be a case number, which in Epic you will have to document. In The Room: Especially when cross-covering, make sure to introduce yourself to family, and allow them time to introduce themselves to you.

Note the location of a working clock when you enter; your watch is ok too but do make sure to avoid looking at your smartphone to check the time of death. The Exam And Pronouncement: Identify the patient by wrist band. Note general appearance. Confirm that the patient does not respond to stimuli; one discreet way to confirm a lack of response to tactile stimuli is to hold the hand, and apply pressure to a nailbed, appearing to hold the hand while looking at/visually inspecting the face or other part of the body. You should avoid any obvious painful stimuli, out of respect for the deceased as well as out of deference to family who may be present. Confirm the absence of spontaneous respirations. Confirm the absence of heart sounds. Examine the pupils and note the absence of pupillary light reflex. Note the time at which your examination is completed. This is the time of death. It is ok (although not required; this is merely a consideration) to speak the time of death quietly and respectfully, for the family\u2019s reference as well as staff\u2019s.

For example, 1 mg of IV morphine is equal to 3 mg of oral morphine. When transitioning, doses are traditionally reduced by \u00bc to \u2153 due to cross tolerance. (Oxycodone 5 is a pretty standard dose, which converts to 7.5 mg of oral morphine, 2.5 mg of iv morphine, and 0.375 of iv hydromorphone.) Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCAs) aka Pain Pumps: Pumps can be programmed to deliver a continuous rate and/or a bolus dose. The basal rate is a continuous infusion dosed per hour that cannot be adjusted by the patient. The demand dose is a patient-directed bolus that is given at a prescribed frequency (whenever the pt presses the button). Both the actual dose and frequency of bolus dose can be adjusted. The general rule of thumb is to calculate the total OME delivered through the demand when a pt is in steady state and convert 75% of this dose into the total continuous rate or basal infusion. Alternatively, if a pt is chronically on a long-acting opioid, this total amount of OME (sustained release) can be converted into a basal rate of opioid. The demand dose is 25% of the hourly rate given every 15 minutes. Remember that the basal rate will not get to steady state for at least 8 hrs; therefore, when you admit pts or are transitioning pts to a PCA, always initiate the PCA pump with a bolus (or loading) dose.

If it does not display info about PCA, hit \u201cChannel Select\u201d on PCA Select \u201cOptions\u201d in bottom left of IV pump Select \u201cPatient History\u201d on the left of the screen. This shows the administration history for a certain time period (e.g., 24h, 12h, 4h, etc) Hit \u201cZoom\u201d on bottom of screen to change time period to 24 hours. Should show: Total Drug: total amount of drug received in last 24 hours Total Demands: amount of times the pt has pushed the button for demand dose Delivered : amount of times the pt actually received a demand dose The difference between \u201cTotal Demands\u201d and \u201cDelivered\u201d is the number of times the patient pushed the button without receiving a dose (due to pushing the button during the lockout interval). If you have questions about interrogating the PCA, ask the nurses! They are a great resource! Opioid Side effects Constipation: dose-dependent and will not develop tolerance. If pt has opioids, they need robust bowel regimen (miralax, senna) with goal of BM \u2265 every 3 days. For opioid-specific constipation can do SQ Relistor (methylnaltrexone) but this is expensive and can only be given in the PCU or oncology floors at VUMC. For patients with chronic opioid-induced constipation as an outpatient can trial oral agents like Movantik (naloxgeol). Can also consider PO naloxone but it does have small amount of bioavailability so watch for systemic reversal. Nausea: occurs with opiate na\u00efve pts. Consider starting an anti-emetic concurrently. Most pts will develop tachyphylaxis with this over a day, so the antiemetic can be discontinued. Urinary retention: Consider role of opioids in pts with new-onset or worsening urinary retention. Try to de-escalate opioid dosing if possible. Overdose: In pts with apneic emergency, IV 0.4 mg Naloxone; however, low threshold for multiple doses until response. With respiratory depression in chronic opioid pts start with IV 0.02 mg q2-3min to avoid profound withdrawal. This helps prevent acute pain crisis. In pts taking long-acting opioids, may need to redose q30min and consider IV infusion for them. For pts prescribed opioids as outpatient, need naloxone 4 mg intransasal. Pruritis: due to histamine release from mast cells; can be treated with antihistamines. The opioid can also be rotated. Some but not all pts will develop tachyphylaxis to this symptom. Toxicity: hyperalgesia and neuroexcitatory effects (AMS, myoclonic jerking, seizures). Risk factors for neuroexcitatory effects are rapid titration, dehydration or renal failure.","title":"Opiate Principles"},{"location":"pain-and-palliative/pain-and-palliative-opiate-principles/#opiate-principles","text":"Opioids: General Principles & Conversion \u2013 Brian Grieb Oral Morphine Equivalent (OME) Conversion Table: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Drug PO IV APAP IR ER Notes Tramadol 0.1x - - Tramadol Ultram ER\u2122 NSAID properties Morphine 1x 3x - Morphine IR MS-Contin\u2122 Renally cleared Hydrocodone 1x NaN Lortab Hydrocodone NaN NaN Oxycodone 1.5x - Percocet Roxicodone\u2122 Oxycontin\u2122 NaN Hydromorphone 4x 20x - IV, Oral - Oral is $ Fentanyl 300x 300x - IV\u2019 Buccal, Nasal Patch Dosed in ug, not mg Abbreviations: ER, extended release; IR, immediate release; IV, intravenous; PO, oral; APAP, Acetaminophen Conversion: Transition between opiates is done using oral morphine equivalents (OMEs), in which each drugs\u2019 potency is compared to oral morphine (see table).

also available in q30d IM Monitor liver enzymes; AST/ALT must be \\< 3-5x ULN Acamprosate (cannot be used in severe renal impairment) Head-to-head, inferior to naltrexone (see COMBINE trial) 333 mg TID, titrating to 666 mg TID dosing Difficult TID dosing may be helpful if framed as commitment/mindfulness practice Disulfiram Infrequently used outside of extreme motivation (e.g. professional under monitoring); would not use outside specialist care Must abstain from alcohol ~2 weeks after last dose, given risk of disulfiram-ethanol reaction (DER), which can be fatal depending upon disulfiram and ethanol doses Topiramate Not FDA-approved for AUD, but has significant supporting evidence Useful for individuals without abstinence goal Titrate slowly over 8 weeks to 200-300 mg/d Gabapentin : Not FDA-approved for AUD, but with some evidence Useful for post-acute withdrawal anxiety, insomnia, or co-occurring neuropathy Titrate to 900-1800 mg/d divided into TID dosing, monitoring for sedation Risk of sedation/apnea if concomitant alcohol use;

I.e. if the pt is on 12/5 the mask will deliver a pressure of 12 when breathing in and 5 when breathing out. 12/5 is a good start, in comments write \u201cauto-titrate\u201d and the RT will have some leeway to change settings Immediate pharmacotherapy, in tandem with diagnostics and airway mgmt Circulation For hemodynamic instability, HR \\< 50, call anesthesia for immediate rapid sequence intubation (RSI). Pt\u2019s can be hypotensive for a host of reasons including pneumothorax, sepsis, circulatory collapse from hypoxia and bradycardia, etc. Subsequent Workup: Continuous pulse oximetry, ABG/VBG, EKG, CXR, CBC, BMP, troponin, BNP (if considering HF dx), Sputum cx, consider blood cx if concern for sepsis, rapid flu. Lung Ultrasound to differentiate COPD from pulmonary edema when a pt presents with wheezing and respiratory failure (pulmonary edema will have Kerley B lines) During evaluation, consider triggers for COPD exacerbation: viral infection (70%), PNA, PE. Have a high index of suspicion for PE in these pts . Management Manage airway as above - many pts will need BiPAP if severe respiratory distress or hypercapnia are present Bronchodilators Order \u201cRespiratory Care Therapy Management Protocol\u201d at VUMC When ordered, an RT evaluates the pt and based on physical exam will give a duoneb The RT will then continue to assess the pt based on severity of the exacerbation If ordering bronchodilators individually (this is discouraged) order: Albuterol 2.5 mg diluted to 3 mL via nebulizer or 4 to 8 inhalations from MDI every 4 hours while awake (RT), or more frequently if needed Ipratropium 500 mcg via nebulizer, or 4-8 inhalations from MDI q 4 hrs while awake Can additionally order \"duoneb\" at VUMC There is no respiratory order protocol at the VA, order individually as above. RT is available to assess if needed Steroids For severe exacerbation give methylprednisolone 125 mg IV BID (or 60mg IV q6h) For moderate to mild COPD exacerbations give prednisone 40mg PO daily for 5 days (including the initial IV dose if pt received one in the ER) Antibiotics Benefit less clear in mild to moderate exacerbations Azithromycin 500mg x 1 then 250mg daily for 4 days or doxycycline 200 mg BID if concern for QT prolongation. Can also consider Levaquin 750mg PO daily for 5 days, however this is often too broad for a standard COPD exacerbation. Refer to \u201cPneumonia\u201d if treating a separate PNA in addition to COPD Discharge Planning: Teaching on medication compliance and appropriate use. Ensure pt has a spacer Pulmonary Rehab Vaccinations (see outpatient management COPD in handbook) Controller medications/inhalers (see outpatient management COPD in handbook) Exacerbation Action plans: No consensus as to what the components should be, but instead a patient-specific plan can be made should the pt\u2019s symptoms recur","title":"COPD Exacerbation Management"},{"location":"pulmonary/pulmonary-cxrs/","text":"CXRs \u00b6 0 How to Interpret Chest Radiographs (CXR) \u2013 Gautam Babu An X-ray is a density-gram where \u201cwhite\u201d is \u201cdense\u201d and \u201cblack\u201d is \u201cnot dense\u201d.

See other sections for information relevant to particular diagnoses If acutely decompensating, Duonebs, IV lasix, Antibiotics depending on clinical picture Supplemental O2 for goal SpO2: >90-92% for most patients (There is generally no need to make SpO2 100%) Between 88-92% for patients with chronic hypoxia from COPD (i.e., on home O2)","title":"Hypoxia"},{"location":"pulmonary/pulmonary-ild/","text":"ILD \u00b6 0 Interstitial Lung Disease \u2013 Gaby Schroeder Background MANY CAUSES, one mnemonic to use: S arcoidosis H ypersensitivity Pneumonitis I diopathic Interstitial Pneumonias (IIPs- UIP/IPF, NSIP, OP, RB-ILD, DIP, LIP, AIP) T uberculosis F ungal A spiration/ Asbestosis (and other Pneumoconiosis) C onnective Tissue Disease + Cancer E osinophilic Pneumonia D rugs Evaluation History: Ask about 1) Duration, timing, severity of primary respiratory symptoms 2) Exposures: Pets, Occupation, Residence, Mold, Feathers, Smoking, Illicits, Travel, Hobbies, Medications (especially amiodarone, nitrofurantoin and chemotherapies) 3) Symptoms of systemic autoimmune disease 4) Family history Chest Imaging: HRCT is best for characterization, but often not achievable or desirable in inpatient setting when patients are critically ill.

If still no output, CT w/ IV contrast to re-evaluate area of the drain, then page 835-0770 (Body Procedures) for abscess drains or page 835-5105 (Vascular IR) for rec\u2019s regarding PCNs, PTCs, or G-tubes. If an abscess drain is malfunctioning, first ensure proper suction/3-way direction. Next instill tPA into the catheter for 2 hours. Epic order: \u201cAlteplase (TPA) injection/infusion options\u201d -> Percutaneous drainage -> 2mg or 4mg (20mL or 40mL, 1mg/10mL concentration). Reach out to Body Procedures service (835-0770) with any questions. If drain is at an operative site, confirm drain tPA is acceptable by surgery team. If this doesn\u2019t improve output in 48 hours, consider repositioning drain (VIR consult).","title":"Consults for Radiology

This is a goal completion date, and this is a project of the US Government. CPRS skills are likely to be useful for a good while yet. Shortcuts \u00b6 CPRS has a rather staggering amount of keyboard shortcuts. The full list is available in this pdf . Task management \u00b6 One of the beautiful and awful things about CPRS is that it is self-contained. It does not interface with the outside world - no push notifications, no easy way to check things on your phone. Within its walled garden, it is also not easy to figure out what has been done and what needs doing. There are a few approaches to task management more-or-less built into CPRS. Tracker Reminder Notes \u00b6 One of the available note types is called \"Tracker Reminder.\" These are unsignable notes (try to sign one and it will fail), that remain in your inbox until deleted. They are a great way to prechart, and you can use them to make notes to yourself about whatever. No one else, including your preceptor, can see what's in them (maybe there's some way for some admin to introspect them, but I haven't heard of anyone who both knows how to do this and cares to look at your personal scribblings). I used to also use them as a general to-do list, and I know some residents live by them throughout training. I don't use them as a catch-all anymore (instead preferring Ticklers, outlined below), and now essentially only use them for pre-charting. In your inbox, all you can see is the patient for whom you have a Tracker Reminder, and the note title (\"UNSIGNED Tracker Reminder\") - there is no good way to differentiate between a precharted note, a to-do item, or anything else you may have written. CPRS is very slow, so clicking into each Tracker Reminder to see what's in there is much too expensive in terms of time. Ticklers \u00b6 Yes, self-assigned alerts in CPRS are called \"Ticklers.\" Because \"Alerts\" is not nearly descriptive enough. To set up Ticklers for yourself, get into a new note or make an addendum. (shout out to Paige, RN extraordinaire, for showing me her approach - it's A-OK to make an addendum with the content of only \"setting alert\") Click \"Templates\" on the bottom left. The first \"Shared Template\" should have the word \"Tickler.\" Double-click it, and it will open up a simple dialogue that asks you when you want to be alerted, and any text you would like within the alert. Then, when the time comes for that alert, it will show up in your universal CPRS inbox. When you click into it, it will show you the text you entered, and give you three options - copy the text of the alert to the clipboard, renew the alert, or close it out. One advantage to this approach over a huge list of Tracker Reminder notes is that your inbox does not become nearly as cluttered, and you can tell more easily what is time-sensitive. I also prefer it over some third-party solution, such as a OneNote page, Word doc, or Excel sheet (all HIPAA-compliant if using your institutional OneDrive account), because all of my VA work and data lives in a single system, so I don't have something else to (forget to) check. Leave-one-behind alert method \u00b6 The most common scenario: see a patient, order some studies. Study results roll in, you need to discuss next steps with the patient. Something is still processing, and/or you don't have time right now to have a phone call. Instead of leaving 6 or 7 alerts for the same person cluttering your inbox, remove all but one (highlight the alerts you want to get rid of and click \"Remove\"). That lone remaining alert functions as a reminder. When the stars align, click into that alert, go through all the recent results, and communicate however makes sense for the situation. Remote Access QoL \u00b6 Text expansion \u00b6 One of the best categories of quality-of-life improvements you can make for using CPRS remotely is text expansion/macros. On Windows, PhraseExpress is great. On Mac, aText is also great. Set up an expansion to [enter your passcode (123456) and hit \"Enter\"]. I have it set to ,c . (I have ,e mapped to my Epic password). This saves so much time and hassle. For example, to sign a note, I hit Ctrl+Shift+g to open the \"Sign Note\" dialog (this is a built-in CPRS shortcut), then I tap ,c , and the note is signed. Takes far less than a second, fingers stay close to home row. The VA made their own tool to do this, called \"CPRSBooster\" (it's somewhere under the Star folder on every desktop). It works. The main utility of CPRSBooster is to give you ideas for other text expansions you could set up, such as your nurse's name for tagging on notes. VistA \u00b6 VistA is the (rather insane) software and database system that undergirds CPRS. I get the sense that the deepest magicks rest in VistA, waiting for the intrepid explorer, seeking a grail filled with automated data extraction and sane clinical workflows. The documentation is scattered. This is one of the official sources. I've only taken a cursory look, but it seems less technical and mostly snarky. There's also a wiki devoted to VistA, though it is not restricted to the official USGovt version (since the software is federally mandated to be open source, it has been forked and developed in several countries worldwide). If you have been inducted into the cult of VistA, and need an acolyte, let me know. I make pretty kickass chocolate chip cookies.","title":"CPRS"},{"location":"zCBH/cprs/#cprs","text":"FYI, the Cerner transition has a goal completion date of 2028.

When the stars align, click into that alert, go through all the recent results, and communicate however makes sense for the situation.","title":"Leave-one-behind alert method"},{"location":"zCBH/cprs/#remote-access-qol","text":"","title":"Remote Access QoL"},{"location":"zCBH/cprs/#text-expansion","text":"One of the best categories of quality-of-life improvements you can make for using CPRS remotely is text expansion/macros. On Windows, PhraseExpress is great. On Mac, aText is also great. Set up an expansion to [enter your passcode (123456) and hit \"Enter\"]. I have it set to ,c . (I have ,e mapped to my Epic password). This saves so much time and hassle. For example, to sign a note, I hit Ctrl+Shift+g to open the \"Sign Note\" dialog (this is a built-in CPRS shortcut), then I tap ,c , and the note is signed. Takes far less than a second, fingers stay close to home row. The VA made their own tool to do this, called \"CPRSBooster\" (it's somewhere under the Star folder on every desktop). It works. The main utility of CPRSBooster is to give you ideas for other text expansions you could set up, such as your nurse's name for tagging on notes.","title":"Text expansion"},{"location":"zCBH/cprs/#vista","text":"VistA is the (rather insane) software and database system that undergirds CPRS. I get the sense that the deepest magicks rest in VistA, waiting for the intrepid explorer, seeking a grail filled with automated data extraction and sane clinical workflows. The documentation is scattered. This is one of the official sources. I've only taken a cursory look, but it seems less technical and mostly snarky. There's also a wiki devoted to VistA, though it is not restricted to the official USGovt version (since the software is federally mandated to be open source, it has been forked and developed in several countries worldwide). If you have been inducted into the cult of VistA, and need an acolyte, let me know. I make pretty kickass chocolate chip cookies.","title":"VistA"}]}
