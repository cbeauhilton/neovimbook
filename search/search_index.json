Requires spontaneously breathing pt Volume Control (AC/VC) PEEP RR TV Inspiratory flow FiO2 Inspiratory pressure Mandates a minute ventilation; limits volutrauma (i.e. can guarantee low tidal volume ventilation) Primary mode used in MICU (mode used in major ARDS trials) SIMV Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation PEEP RR TV PS above PEEP FiO2 Pt gets VC breath for set rate, but if tries to breath over this will get PS breath; VC and PS breaths are synchronized when able Pressure Control (AC/PC) RR Inspiratory Pressure PEEP Inspiratory Time (or I:E ratio) FiO2 TV Minimizes barotrauma (i.e. sets a max inspiratory pressure) does not guarantee a specific minute ventilation (must monitor PCO2 with blood gases) Does not have natural ventilator alarms for protection \u2013 need to increase low minute ventilation alarm threshold PRVC Pressure Regulated Volume Control PEEP RR TV Inspiratory flow Pressure max FiO2 Adaptive pressure control (NOT actually a volume control mode); tries to limit both barotrauma and volutrauma but if in conflict, minute ventilation will drop (i.e. need to monitor PCO2 with blood gases like any other PC mode) Con: More the pt works, the less the ventilator does APRV / Bilevel PEEP (PLow) Pressure High Time Low Time High FiO2 TV Long periods of inspiratory holds and very brief expirations (i.e. releases), for refractory hypoxemia. Often difficult to ventilate pts on this mode Introduction to Vent Management \u00b6 Jared Freitas Ventilator Settings \u00b6 See table in Modes of Oxygen Delivery for variables adjusted in each ventilator mode Trigger: what initiates a breath; time, flow, or pressure (pt triggers are flow and pressure) Static Ventilator Readouts \u00b6 Plateau pressure (Pplat): measure with inspiratory hold, assesses static lung compliance Auto-PEEP: measure with expiratory hold; occurs when volume of previous breath is not entirely expelled before the next breath is initiated Dynamic Ventilator Readouts \u00b6 Measured RR: in most modes, pt may trigger breaths above set RR; if set and measured RR match consider \u2193 respiratory drive (sedation, neurologic injury) or iatrogenic over-ventilation VTi / VTe: tidal volume of inspiration (VTi) and expiration (VTe) VTi should approximately equal VTe, if not then concern for air leak (e.g. cuff leak or pneumothorax) or auto-PEEP Minute ventilation: calculated from VTe x RR; higher MV = more CO2 clearance Peak pressure: highest pressure reached in the entire ventilator cycle Critical Non-ventilator hemodynamic readouts \u00b6 SpO2: if poor waveform or discordant with PaO2, may need serial ABG HR: quickest indicator of emergencies such as pneumothorax, PE, ventilator disconnection Blood pressure: positive pressure ventilation decreases preload and afterload; depending on the underlying pt physiology, increases in positive pressure may be detrimental or beneficial for BP Alarm Type What is causing the alarm? Troubleshooting High Peak Pressure Static compliance issue (stretch of the lung-doesn\u2019t change with airflow) versus dynamic compliance issue (resistance of the circuit when there is air flowing) Step 1: Check plateau pressure by performing inspiratory hold. Must be in VC mode. High Peak and Low Plateau = Dynamic compliance issue High Resistance Check circuit tubing for excess water condensation or a kink. Ask RT to disconnect and clear circuit Check if patient is biting ETT bite block, pain control/sedation Incline suction to clear secretions or proximal mucous plug Auscultate for wheezing or stridor to indicate bronchospasm or airway obstruction->give bronchodilators High Peak and High Plateau = Static compliance issue Worsening alveolar process Emergencies to quickly assess for: Tension pneumothorax (exam, US for lung sliding, CXR) Main stem intubation (ask about any tube migration, listen to breath sounds, CXR) Consider worsening alveolar process leading to decreased lung compliance: worsening pulmonary edema, PNA, DAH, ARDS or other non-alveolar process such as new pleural effusion, obesity, intraabdominal hypertension/compartment syndrome CXR, US to assess for b-lines, tracheal aspirate, bronch, etc Treat according to etiology (chest tube, reposition ETT, diuresis, abx, etc) Low Tidal Volume/Low Minute Ventilation (VE) Pt is not getting the desired tidal volume/VE that was set in the vent parameters. The alarm reports exhaled VE. May cause inadequate ventilation, CO2 retention, potentially hypoxia Compare inspiratory tidal volumes (Vti) with expiratory tidal volumes (Vte) on the ventilator. If Vti>Vte, check for a leak in the system Have RT check all connections Listen for a cuff leak \u2013 can have RT check a cuff pressure and if low then re-inflate->sometimes need to do an ETT exchange If low tidal volumes and no leak (ie. Vti = Vte) and RR WNL Pt may need more support, ie switching to a different vent mode (PS to PRVC). Discuss with RT or fellow If low RR and no leak and Vt at goal Patient may be oversedated Ensure pt has a back-up rate in case they aren\u2019t triggering the vent->may need to switch vent modes for this (i.e. take off pressure support) or increase set/ventilator respiratory rate Apnea No breaths are being triggered by the vent your patient is NOT breathing this is an emergency *** Check that patient hasn't self-extubated, trach hasn't fallen out, or been unhooked from vent*** If self-extubated or tracheostomy decannulated, then immediately start bagging the patient (may need to bag from trach stoma if s/p laryngectomy). Have nurse call staff assist so that patient can be re-intubated if necessary or have trach team called to replace a fresh (<7 days old) trach Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) \u00b6 Judd Heideman Background \u00b6 A syndrome of diffuse inflammation and injury of the alveoli and capillary endothelium leading to fluid and protein accumulation in the interstitium and alveoli, pulmonary edema, and hypoxemic respiratory failure; 30-50% mortality rate Triggers: Pulmonary Pneumonia (viral and bacterial) \u2022 Lung contusion Direct inhalation injury \u2022 Aspiration Primary graft dysfunction of pulmonary transplant Extra-pulmonary Sepsis (most common cause) \u2022 HSCT Trauma \u2022 Burns Massive blood transfusions/TRALI \u2022 Pancreatitis Drugs (amiodarone, chemotherapy, cocaine, opioids) Evaluation \u00b6 Diagnosis: Berlin Criteria New or worsening respiratory symptoms beginning within one week of diagnosis New bilateral opacities present on chest radiograph or CT chest Not explained by effusions, collapse of lobe/lung, or nodules Absence of left heart failure or volume overload Severity: based on PaO2/FiO2 ratio with a PEEP \u2265 5 cm H2O PaO2 = arterial partial pressure of O2 (requires ABG) FiO2 = fraction of inspired oxygen (expressed as a decimal between 0.21 and 1.0) PaO2/FiO2 ratio PEEP Mild 201-300 \u22655 Moderate 101-200 \u22655 Severe \\<100 \u22655 Management \u00b6 Frequently requires intubation;

generally determined empirically at the bedside Titrate up slowly; generally do not exceed PEEP 18 Limited by high plateau pressures/barotrauma, overdistension/dead space ventilation, decreased preload/venous return ARDSnet FiO2/PEEP Tables: At VUMC we typically use the Lower PEEP table Other recruitment maneuvers Reposition pt \u2013 can try elevating HOB or positioning so \u201cgood lung\u201d is down If concern for mucus plug, consider need for bronch If concern for significant atelectasis can try recruitment maneuvers with the vent including sustained inflation (setting expiratory pressure to ~30 for ~30 seconds) and PEEP titration (setting PEEP to 20-25 and decreasing by 2cm at a time) \u2013 call the fellow before attempting Management Algorithm for Refractory Hypoxemia \u00b6 Inhaled vasodilators: Distribute preferentially to well-ventilated alveoli local vasodilation improved V/Q matching VUMC formulary preference: inhaled epoprostenol (aka Flolan) Alternatives: inhaled milrinone, inhaled nitric oxide Data suggest improved PaO2/FiO2; large RCT without evidence for mortality benefit Deep sedation (RASS -4 or -5) Promotes ventilator synchrony Neuromuscular blockade (paralysis) \u2013 call your fellow before doing this Rationale: maximal vent synchrony (eliminates residual chest wall/diaphragm tone) Pt MUST be RASS -5 (need analgesia + sedation) Trial one time IV push of vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg If improved vent synchrony/oxygenation, consider cisatracurium (Nimbex) drip Data are mixed ACURASYS 2010 (improved 90-day mortality but underpowered likely overestimating benefit); ROSE 2019 (no difference in 90-day mortality) Prone positioning (Need attending approval) Pts with moderate to severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ratio \\< 150) At VUMC, we use regular ICU beds and manually flip pts; cycle prone 16 hrs/supine 8 hrs When proning or supining a pt, always have a provider who can intubate in the room in case unplanned extubation occurs Considerations: need a team of people to reposition, high risk of ET tube malposition, difficult to access lines/perform procedures, high risk of pressure injuries Data: PROSEVA 2013 proning improved 28-day mortality; study complicated by imbalances between groups Alternative ventilator modes (usually Pressure Control or APRV/BiLevel/BiVent) APRV/BiVent should be avoided in people with bad obstructive lung disease, hemodynamic instability, refractory hypercarbia Venovenous (V-V) ECMO Indications for hypoxemia: PaO2/FiO2 \\< 50 with FiO2 >80% for >3 hrs OR PaO2/FiO2 \\< 80 with FiO2 >80% for >6 hrs AND Mechanical ventilation \u2264 1 week Absolute Contraindications: Poor short-term prognosis (e.g. metastatic cancer) Irreversible, devastating neurologic pathology Chronic respiratory insufficiency without the possibility for transplant Can calculate RESP score predicts in-hospital survival with ECMO CONSULT EARLY if a pt may be a candidate; allows ECMO team to assist with evaluation Data: CESAR 2009: improved 6-month survival without severe disability EOLIA 2018 : no mortality benefit but 28% crossover from control to ECMO arm dilutes potential effects Refractory Hypercapnia \u00b6 Amelia Muhs Background \u00b6 Inadequate clearance of CO2 leading to respiratory acidosis (pH \u2264 7.20) despite maximum RR&TV (i.e. minute ventilation) tolerated without causing barotrauma or autoPEEP Common causes: Obstructive lung disease (COPD, emphysema, asthma) Hypoventilation (sleep apnea, obesity, sedative medications (ie opiates), neuromuscular weakness, chest wall trauma, ascites/pleural effusion) Increased CO2 load (shock, sepsis, malignant hyperthermia) Presentation: Shortness of breath AMS, somnolence Hypoxemia Tachycardia, hypertension (in some cases) Evaluation \u00b6 Physical exam, mental status, recent medications ABG or VBG \u2013 if increased PCO2 and normal pH, always treat the pH and not the PCO2 (i.e., may be compensated chronic hypercarbia and blowing off more CO2 may be harmful) Management Algorithm \u00b6 Special considerations If history of OSA, make sure they are on home CPAP/BiPAP If opiate related trial narcan Bronchodilators for reactive airway diseases BiPAP Contraindicated if pt unable to remove BiPAP mask on their own Increase MV by increasing \u0394 between IPAP/EPAP or increasing RR Mechanical ventilation Allows you to control rate and tidal volume (in Volume Control modes) NOTE: some pts have higher minute ventilation on their own compared to mechanical ventilation (e.g., DKA); pt-specific considerations regarding intubation To increase minute ventilation and CO2 clearance: Increase RR 30-35 is about as high as you can go Need to keep in mind I/E time to avoid breath stacking/autoPEEP (gas trapped in lungs) Some signs of autoPEEP include worsening hypotension and the expiratory limb on the flow waveform on the vent not returning to zero Increase TV we usually start at 4-6mL/kg IBW. You can consider increasing to 8mL/kg IBW as long as plateau pressures remain \\< 30 cm H2O Goal peak pressures \u2264 35 cm H2O / plateau pressures \u2264 30 cm H2O ARDS permissive hypercapnia (goal pH \u2265 7.2) V-V ECMO / Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) Indications for hypercapnia: Severe dynamic hyperinflation and/or severe respiratory acidosis pH \u2264 7.25 with PaCO2 \u2265 60 for 6 hr with RR at 35/min and TV increased to target maximum MV while keeping plateau pressure \u2264 32 cm H2O Similar considerations and contraindications as refractory hypoxemia (see above) Benefits: Reduces work of breathing, promotes early ventilator weaning/extubating allows early mobilization and recovery Tracheostomy \u00b6 Jared Freitas Indications \u00b6 Prolonged mechanical intubation and weaning Tracheal stenosis Acute airway obstructions (head and neck cancers) Trauma Neuromuscular disease Benefits of Tracheostomy vs ET tube \u00b6 Improved pt comfort and decreased need for sedation Reduced laryngeal damage Increased ability to communicate (i.e. speaking valve) May decrease risk of developing ventilator associated pneumonia (mixed data) May reduce time to wean from the vent and decrease time in the hospital (mixed data) Timing \u00b6 No mortality difference or \u2193 in hospital length of stay for early (day 4) vs late (day 10) Generally performed after 2 weeks of intubation, but not backed by data Pts that might get tracheostomy earlier: anticipated prolonged mechanical ventilation (i.e. those with acute neurologic injury affecting spinal cord) Types of Tracheostomy Tubes \u00b6 Different brands: most common in hospital = Shiley Components: Faceplate: keeps tube in place, has the model and size on it Inner cannula: can be removed, cleaned and replaced in case of obstruction Cuff (may or may not have): allows for pt to be ventilated; may prevent some aspiration Fenestration (may or may not have): allow speaking without valve Common sizes: Initial: 8-0; Standard downsizing: 6-0 Lengths: standard vs. larger XLT (P = longer proximal end, D = longer distal end) Presenting on ICU rounds = size/cuff status/brand (e.g. 8-0 cuffed shiley) Speaking Valves \u00b6 Passy Muir Valve (PMV): one-way valve placed on the outer portion of the trach; air moves in with inspiration but is blocked and thus funneled up through the vocal cords during exhalation allowing for phonation Contraindication: severe upper airway obstruction or aspiration risk, copious secretions, decreased cognitive status, severe medical instability, or inability to tolerate cuff deflation IMPORTANT SAFETY PRINCIPLE: cuff must be deflated, since air needs to be able to travel back up the airway, if the cuff is not deflated and you put the PMV on, then pt cannot exhale Maintenance of Tracheostomy Tubes \u00b6 Inner cannula should be cleaned 2-3 times per day Daily stoma care should be initiated to prevent pressure ulcers and stoma infections As needed suctioning for secretions Complications and airway emergencies in a tracheostomy pt \u00b6 Hemorrhage (mild bleeding from surface vessels and granulation tissue is common, major bleeding is rare think erosion into brachiocephalic [innominate] artery) Airway damage subglottic or tracheal stenosis; tracheobronchitis Fistulas (tracheoarterial, tracheoesophageal) Unintended tracheostomy tube dislodgement: Bag mask (use hand/gauze to occlude stoma) or intubate from above (i.e. through the mouth); if complete laryngectomy then must use stoma Fresh trach (\u2264 14 days): do NOT replace due to risk of misplacement into the mediastinum and loss of airway;

Manage with fluids/pressors if need, rule out other causes (ex: hypoxia, PTX) Hypoxemia: Preoxygenate with 100% FiO2 to minimize risk. Rescue maneuvers with bag mask ventilation if needed Mechanical injury: Dental, soft tissue, tracheal, laryngeal. Retrieve any dislodged teeth, suction blood Extubation \u00b6 Is the patient ready to be extubated? \u00b6 Are they oxygenating well? SpO2 \u226590% with FiO2 \u226450% and PEEP \u22648cm H20 Has the underlying cause of their respiratory failure improved? Did patient pass their SBT? See ABCDEF Bundle section for details on SBT Is patient able to protect their airway? Is the patient on a stable pressor requirement or no pressors? Is patient coughing and clearing secretions? Is patient off sedation, alert and following commands? Positive cuff leak? (See below for steps) Consider calculating the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI): RR/tidal volume (L) Set PS at 0cm H2O, and PEEP at 5cm H2O and, measure VT & RR for one minute. RSBI \u2265 105 predicts likely failure to wean. The use of a RSBI is attending dependent at Vanderbilt and is not frequently calculated when assessing readiness for extubation Post-extubation complications \u00b6 Post-extubation stridor: 2/2 laryngeal edema Positive cuff leak test= high risk methylprednisolone 20 mg i.v. q4h x 4 prior to extubation to prevent If after extubation: Methylprednisolone 40 mg i.v. x1 dose + inhaled racemic epinephrine. If stridor >60minutes, consider reintubation Cuff leak test: Suction secretions and set the ventilator into the AC mode Inflate the cuff and record inspiratory and expiratory VT to evaluate for differences between the two volumes Deflate the cuff record the expiratory VT over the next six breathing cycles. Average the three lowest expiratory VT values The cuff leak volume is the difference between the inspiratory VT (measured before the cuff was deflated) and the averaged expiratory VT. If the difference is \\<100cc, this is considered failure but is not an absolute contradiction to extubation Post-extubation respiratory failure Recurrent hypoxic or hypercarbic respiratory failure Assess for aggravating factors (volume overload, shock, AMS, etc) For hypercarbic respiratory failure, may trial BiPAP. If unsuccessful reintubate Preventative post-extubation BiPAP not routinely used in all patients but consider in select populations at high risk for failure: severe COPD with preexisting chronic hypercarbia during SBT, patients intubated for cardiogenic pulmonary edema Ultrasound in Critical Care \u00b6 Audrey White Volume assessment \u00b6 IVC measurements Clinical Questions: Will the patient respond to fluid resuscitation? Is CVP low or high? Protocol: See cardiology POCUS section Limitations: Non applicable in patients with elevated abdominal pressure or abdominal contractions during measurement Troubleshooting: Use the liver as a window to the IVC to avoid bowel gas. Start at the right mid-axillary line with the leading edge toward the head of the patient, and fan to view the IVC in longitudinal axis. Lung Assessment \u00b6 Lung ultrasound relies on recognition of ultrasound artifacts to identify normal and pathologic findings. Normal findings \u201cBat sign\u201d: Ultrasound cannot penetrate reflective rib surface, casting a vertical shadow A- lines: hyperechoic horizontal lines descending from the pleural line at regular intervals. This reverberation artifact occurs in normal aerated lung Pathologic findings B-lines, comet tails: Vertical hyperechoic lines which (1) extend from the pleural line through the depth of the image, (2) move with lung sliding, and (3) obliterate A lines. Multiple B lines indicates excess interstitial fluid Lung rockets: >3 B lines indicates interstitial syndrome. Most common cause is acute pulmonary edema, also consider ARDS, PNA, pulmonary fibrosis, & pulmonary contusion. Helps distinguish CHF vs COPD exacerbation in patients with dyspnea Loss of lung sliding, barcode sign: The shimmering, twinkling appearance of the dynamic aerated lung is lost. Can confirm in M-mode with barcode sign- smooth homogenous lines indicating no movement of lung tissue. Lung sliding=suspicion for PTX but NOT specific unless can identify lung point Lung Point: The precise location where the lung detaches from the pleura can sometimes be identified. Can confirm in M-mode which will show \u201cbarcode\u201d and \u201cseashore\u201d patterns adjacent. 100% specific for pneumothorax Pleural effusion, jellyfish sign: Anechoic fluid is visualized between the diaphragm and dynamic lung Probe: linear or phased array Protocol Adjust the depth to ~10cm to start. Position the probe vertically on the midclavicular line. Slide the probe so that the hyperechoic pleural line is visualized between rib shadows. Note presence/absence of A lines, B lines, lung sliding, and alveolar consolidation Repeat on the opposite side and lower anterior lung fields Repeat on the right and left mid-axillary line, upper and lower lung fields. Look for pleural effusion between the diaphragm and lung Repeat on the posterior lung fields if indicated to complete a 12-zone lung examination Cardiovascular \u00b6 Goal-directed echocardiography for acute shock Pericardial tamponade Apical 4 chamber (A4C): pericardial effusion, may see end diastolic collapse of right atrium Parasternal long (PLAX): pericardial effusion will appear anterior to thoracic descending aorta, may see collapsing right ventricle False positives: pericardial cyst, pericardial fat pad, pleural effusion (posterior to thoracic descending aorta on PLAX) Acute cor pulmonale PLAX, PSAX: paradoxical septal motion, D shaped left ventricle, dilated RV A4C: end-diastolic RV area : LV area > 1 Subxiphoid (SUX): dilated IVC LVEF- see cardiology section Abdominal assessments \u00b6 FAST exam Clinical questions: Is there fluid in the peritoneal or pericardial spaces? Probe: curvilinear or phased array Protocol Start on abdominal mode at depth 21-25cm. Assess for pericardial effusion in SUX view Reduce depth to 12-16cm and place probe on the right anterior axillary line between ribs 8-12 with the indicator toward the patient\u2019s head. Sweep medially to identify the right kidney. Assess for anechoic fluid in Morrison\u2019s pouch between the kidney and liver, subdiaphragmatic space, and paracolic gutter. Rock the probe to assess for fluid cephalad to the diaphragm. Slide inferiorly to confirm no fluid around the inferior pole of the kidney Place probe on the left anterior axillary line between ribs 8-11 with the leading edge toward the patient\u2019s head. Sweep medially to identify the left kidney. Assess for anechoic fluid in the splenorenal interface, subdiaphragmatic space, pleural space, paracolic gutter, and left kidney inferior pole Place probe midline just superior to the pubic symphysis. Identify the bladder in longitudinal and transverse view. Assess for fluid outside the bladder wall and in the pouch of Douglas (females) or rectovesicular space (males) Limitations: Cannot detect retroperitoneal bleed. False positives from ascites, pleural effusion, subcapsular hematoma, ruptured cysts, physiologic fluid in pouch of Douglas, epicardial fat pad. Exam may be indeterminant if significant bowel gas or obesity Small bowel obstruction assessment Overall SBO ultrasound has ~92% sensitivity and ~97% specificity to detect SBO and greater diagnostic accuracy than abdominal XR Probe: curvilinear Protocol: Have the patient lie supine and relax the abdominal wall. Place the probe vertically on the abdomen and sweep across all four quadrants in sagittal view. Repeat in transverse view. Measure small bowel wall thickness and diameter using the caliper tool Signs of SBO: Diameter > 2cm \u2022 Decreased peristalsis Wall thickness > 4mm \u2022 Back and forth stool movement Tanga sign: In severe SBO, may see triangular pocket hypoechoic free fluid surrounding the small bowel near the obstruction Renal ultrasound Protocol is similar to FAST exam. Fan the probe through each kidney in sagittal and transverse view to assess for dilation of the collecting ducts. To move the kidney inferiorly, ask the patient to take a deep breath Bilateral hydronephrosis and full bladder suggests urinary obstruction distal to the ureter Unilateral hydronephrosis suggests nephrolithiasis or ureteral obstruction Limitations: Renal US has a reported sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 75% to detect nephrolithiasis compared to CT Running Codes \u00b6 Jacqueline Visina Arrival to a Code \u00b6 Questions to answer when you arrive: Is someone running the code? Who is doing compressions? Do we have pads on the patient? What is our IV access? Take charge: establish if anyone is actively running the code, if someone is running the code, introduce yourself and ask how you may be helpful. If someone is NOT, have someone begin chest compressions IMMEDIATELY and assume responsibility for the running the code IV access: IV access preferred, if no immediate IV access, place IO Obtain a brief medical history and events surrounding the code and the patient\u2019s code status Have someone find the nearest crash cart and get pads on the patient as soon as possible Running the Code \u00b6 Assess the rhythm If Vfib/VT- immediately shock For polymorphic VT, this is ischemia until proven otherwise unless the patient is on a large amount of QTc prolonging medications. If PEA/Asystole- resume compressions, give Epi 1mg ASAP Strong ACLS Q2min- pulse check, rhythm check, shock? Remember the two interventions with proven mortality benefit are high quality chest compressions and early defibrillation. Do not interrupt these actions for other things Monitor the quality of chest compressions Warn resuscitators when shock is being delivered Consider Advanced Airway Remember chest compressions save lives. Not intubation. Do not stop compressions for intubation Stay Calm Closed Loop communication- continue giving instructions, use names, minimize interruptions Do not move from foot of bed if you are running the code Ensure delivery of adequate compressions. Avoid excessive ventilation If you are running the code, it is helpful to maintain a constant verbal running summary of interventions that have been tried and the course of the code Have a member of the team locate an ultrasound for line placement and diagnostics Allow family to be present H\u2019s and T\u2019s: Treat Reversible Factors Some of the fellows here will empirically give 2 grams of magnesium, 1 amp of D50, 1 amp of bicarb, and 1g calcium chloride at the onset of the code irrespective of presenting rhythm Can send Labs \u2013 ask for a \u201cloaded gas\u201d. This will usually be a VBG/ABG with lactate, K, Ca, and Hgb. Often information does not result quick enough to change immediate management. Have someone look up most recent labs in Epic (looking for recent hyperK, acidosis) Terminating a Code \u00b6 Consider initial rhythm, patient comorbidities, cardiac vs non-cardiac arrest, bedside echo findings. ROSC or rhythm changes during code? Persistent ETCO2\\< 10mmHg after 20min CPR has minimal survival Ask your team if they have any other therapies that they feel would be indicated Ask if anyone remains in favor of continuing CPR When unanimous, terminate the code and announce time of death. Thank your team. Take a moment of silence for the deceased patient Post-Arrest Care \u00b6 Immediately following ROSC is the most dangerous point of ACLS Airway: Secure airway if not done during code, ensure RT avoids hypoxia or hyperoxia BP: MAPs>65, IVF and/or pressors if needed If on floor, prioritize moving patient to a unit for ongoing care once hemodynamically stable enough for transfer. Would not delay for other diagnostics/interventions (lines, CXR, etc) Cardiac: obtain EKG. Assess if urgent cardiac intervention is required for STEMI vs unstable cardiogenic shock vs VT storm or Vfib Neuro: if not following commands, consider TTM. TTM is still performed at VUMC with a strict protocol and inclusion criteria. If there is any question about TTM eligibility, page the CCU fellow Send rainbow labs (CBC, CMP, Mg, coags, trop, lactate, VBG/ABG). Treat rapidly reversible causes CXR Propofol/fentanyl infusion if the patient is intubated. Pressor of choice post ROSC is usually levophed If not done during the code, usually central access will be obtained and an arterial line will be placed Intern role during codes \u00b6 maintain hand on femoral pulse place IO if needed have access to the patient\u2019s chart to answer questions that arise during the code. If family is not available, looking up primary contact information is invaluable. In the MICU, your role is to grab the yellow IO kit prior to leaving for the code Family presence during CPR \u00b6 Studies show that it reduces the frequency of PTSD-related symptoms and does not interfere with medical efforts Treatable Causes of Cardiac Arrest: The H\u2019s and T\u2019s H\u2019s T\u2019s Hypoxia Toxins Hypovolemia Tamponade H+ Tension Pneumothorax Hypo/Hyper K Thrombosis: Pulmonary Hypothermia Thrombosis: Coronary","title":"Management of Shock"},{"location":"critical-care/main/#management-of-shock","text":"Alex Toporex, Soibhan Kelley","title":"Management of Shock"},{"location":"critical-care/main/#distributive-shock","text":"","title":"Distributive Shock"},{"location":"critical-care/main/#background","text":"Pathophysiology: severe, peripheral vasodilation CO/CI increased, SVR decreased, PCWP and RAP normal to low Etiologies: sepsis (most common), anaphylaxis, neurogenic, adrenal insufficiency, pancreatitis Signs/symptoms: Sepsis: localizing signs of infection; tachycardia, tachypnea, may be hypo/hyperthermic; POCUS with hyperdynamic cardiac function Anaphylaxis: history of anaphylaxis; urticaria, edema, diarrhea, wheezing on exam Neurogenic: history of CNS trauma; focal neurologic deficits on exam Adrenal insufficiency: hx chronic steroid use, may have GI symptoms, hyponatremia (common), hyperkalemia (rare), hypoglycemia, hypo/hyperthermia, NAGMA Pancreatitis: abdominal pain, elevated lipase, evidence on CT scan","title":"Background"},{"location":"critical-care/main/#management","text":"Sepsis: see sepsis section Anaphylaxis: 0.3mg IM epinephrine ASAP to be repeated q5-15min x 3; after third IM epi, consider IVF and epi gtt if persistent hypotension.

Steroid-induced Hyperglycemia: Steroids increase insulin resistance \u2192 elevated postprandial BG most notable - 2-3 fold \u2191 in TDD insulin usually required w/ high dose (prednisone > 20 mg) - Common approaches: Double prandial + correction dose (basal the same) Modified basal bolus regimen (30% basal, 70% bolus) Add NPH (weight + dose based, per below*)\u2014 If on prednisone once daily (and not already on MDI), can add NPH once daily (give at same time as prednisone d/t similar pharmacologic profile if terms of peak effect and duration) prednisone 10 mg = 0.1 u/kg NPH prednisone 20 mg = 0.2 u/kg NPH up to max dose NPH 0.4 un/kg daily (w/ prednisone) *lower dose if AKI Additional Information VA tips: At the VA, NPH is formulary rather than Lantus. If a pt takes Lantus at home, this can be continued, but otherwise you will need to place a PADR consult. NPH\u2019s duration of action is shorter than Lantus (12-18 hrs if normal GFR) and in most cases should be dosed Q12h. The conversion is done by taking total Lantus dose and dividing it two doses. Ex: home Lantus 20 units qhs \u2192 NPH 10 units BID Patients getting tube feeds: Best with continuous tube feeds to give regular insulin q6h (not TIDAC since they don\u2019t have distinct \u201cmeals\u201d); you can titrate rapidly, turn off safely (e.g procedures) Then consolidate for bolus feedings based on 24-hour insulin needs prior to d/c Patients with insulin pumps : If a patient has a pump and supplies, reasonably controlled BG, is willing and able to manage pump then s/he can keep the pump on Still order POC BG checks ACHS for nurse to chart and fill out MedEx pump contract Consult Endocrine routinely","title":"Diabetes: Inpatient Management"},{"location":"endocrinology/endocrinology-dka/","text":"DKA \u00b6 Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) \u2013 Will Bassett Background Classically in type 1 diabetes but can also occur in insulin-dependent type 2 diabete Definition: \u2191 blood glucose (typically >350) w/ high anion gap and ketones in blood/urine If glucose is significantly elevated but no ketones/anion gap present, you likely have HHS \u2191 serum osm and BG > 600 commonly seen Evaluation Workup aimed at discovering the underlying cause (The \"I\u2019s\"): I nfection/ I nflammation - CBC, CXR, UA/UCx, LFTs; consider BCx, lipase (pancreatitis).

transient are associated with thrombotic risk Anticardiolipin antibodies B2GP1 (anti-beta2-glycoprotein) antibodies Must also meet at least 1 of the following clinical criteria: Vascular thrombosis: DVT, arterial thrombosis, or small vessel thrombosis of any organ Pregnancy loss: there are specific criteria for this \u2013 consult UpToDate or other resource Management Aspirin for primary prevention; warfarin for treatment (INR 2-3) Do NOT use DOACs for APLS (see TRAPS trial: rivaroxaban inferior to warfarin) Rituximab for recurrent thrombosis despite anticoagulation (controversial) Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) Type 1: Mild and self-limited (not immune-mediated) Occurs within the first 2 days of first-time exposure Platelet count normalizes with continued heparin therapy Type 2 (what we typically refer to as HIT): Immune mediated Fall in plt 30% to over 50% (even if plt count >150) and/or thrombotic event has occurred 4-10 days after new exposure to heparin derivative OR\u2264 1 day after restarting heparin derivative that had been used 30-100 days prior If exposed to heparin within 100 days, will have platelet drop within 24 hr Frequency: unfractionated heparin > LMWH; Surgical wards > medical wards 50% will have thrombotic event in 30 days if HIT is untreated, with 20% mortality Arterial thrombi are common in HIT HIT results from antibodies to complexes of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin, further activating platelets (the activated platelets aggregate causing thrombocytopenia) Evaluation 4T score (0-8 points): Thrombocytopenia (0-2 pts): degree and nadir of platelet count drop Timing (0-2 pts): timing of fall after initial or recurrent heparin exposure Thrombosis (0-2 pts): thrombosis, skin necrosis, non-necrotizing lesions, acute systemic reaction to heparin Other causes of thrombocytopenia (0-2 pts): more points if no alternate cause Solid-phase ELISA for heparin-PF4 antibodies: \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b 0.2-0.4 is indeterminate > 0.4 is positive > 1.4 HIT is likely > 2 confirms HIT \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b The lab at VUMC will perform functional SRA reflexively for all values >0.2 Management 0-3 points: Low concern for HIT;

Brain biopsy may be indicated if diagnostic uncertainty. Management: Pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin is the preferred regimen, discuss dosing with pharmacy. Alternative regimens: clindamycin, Bactrim, atovaquone, and/or azithromycin. - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) Presentation: chronic (weeks to months), progressive neurologic dysfunction, particularly incoordination and other motor dysfunction, aphasia, sometimes cognitive impairment and personality changes Evaluation: MRI brain w/patchy areas of demyelination in the subcortical white matter; location is variable, but p arietal, occipital, and cerebellar involvement are common. JC virus PCR from CSF. Brain biopsy (uncommonly done) Management: Initiation of ART may slow/stop progression. Fatal if HIV goes untreated. - HIV-related encephalopathy Presentation: Similar to other progressive dementias, with short term memory loss followed by worsening global cognitive dysfunction, motor deficits, sometimes seizures in late stages Evaluation: MRI w/diffuse cerebral atrophy and/or demyelinating lesions similar to PML. CSF w/elevated protein \u00b1 lymphocytic pleocytosis, with no alternative cause. Send HIV RNA from the CSF, usually + in HIV encephalopathy - Cryptococcal meningitis Presentation: Subacute to chronically worsening HA and fevers; meningismus and photophobia may be present but are often absent; rarely, focal neurologic deficits Evaluation: LP to check opening pressure and can send serum and CSF Cryptococcus Ag. Brain imaging may be non-diagnostic Treatment: Induction therapy with amphotericin and flucytosine x14 days (at least), with repeat LP close to end of induction to confirm CSF inflammation is improving and fungal culture is negative. Maintenance therapy consists of high dose fluconazole for at least 8 weeks. Pts may require serial LP to manage ICP Delay ART for several weeks after start of treatment to avoid risk of IRIS. - CMV retinitis (with vision loss) Presentation: Blurry vision, focal blind spots, visual field deficits, or scotomas and floaters. Typically begins unilateral, though often progresses to bilateral involvement. Evaluation: Always consult ophtho if you suspect it! Hemorrhagic retinitis, \u201ctomato soup and milk\u201d appearance on dilated exam. May cause complete retinal detachment. Check CMV pcr serum (or vitreous) Management: PO valgancyclovir (+intravitreous ganciclovir or foscarnet in severe disease). If not on ART, must delay ART for at least 2 weeks after start of CMV retinitis treatment to prevent immune recovery uveitis Pulmonary - Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) Presentation: fever, shortness of breath, cough (usually non-productive), sometimes night sweats and weight loss. Hypoxia out of proportion to exam. Evaluation: CT chest appearance usually bilateral and diffuse with GGOs and cystic lesions of varying size. Large cysts can rupture, causing pneumothorax. Induced sputum (or bronchoscopy sample) with cytology and GMS stain. Send serum LDH and 1,3-BD-glucan: should be elevated, but are nonspecific. Management: Bactrim is the preferred treatment; PO is preferable as Bactrim is 100% bioavailable. **If patient is hypoxic, need to consider of adding steroids, can measure A-a gradient. Alternative regimens may include primaquine + clindamycin or IV (NOT inhaled) pentamidine. - Pulmonary tuberculosis Presentation: With low CD4, can have upper lobe cavities but also atypical radiographic pattern, including a normal-appearing CXR. Have a high degree of suspicion in any patient with advanced HIV and respiratory complaints. Evaluation: TB skin tests and IGRAs have a high false negative rate in advanced HIV. At VUMC, any pt with HIV and respiratory complaints must be placed on airborne until TB ruleout- 3 sputum mycobacterial cultures collected at least 8 hours apart. If concentrated smear is negative x3, TB is unlikely (though have to follow up final culture to be sure). Management: RIPE therapy is the standard initial treatment, with adjustment if needed for drug resistance or contraindications - Herpes simplex tracheobronchitis and/or pneumonitis/pneumonia Evaluation: bronchoscopy with positive HSV PCR from BAL \u00b1 lung biopsy. (Usually associated with HSV-1) Management: agent and duration not well defined for bronchopulmonary disease; depending on severity of presentation, likely IV acyclovir to start followed by transition to PO antiviral once evidence of clinical improvement, for a total of 10-14 days. - Recurrent pneumonia NOS Histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, coccidiomycosis, and non-TB mycobacterial infections (including MAC) limited to the pulmonary system are not AIDs defining illnesses, though pts with advanced HIV and other severely immunosuppressed states are at higher risk. Gastrointestinal - Esophageal candidiasis Presentation: Dysphagia, odynophagia or both. Concurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis (\u201cthrush\u2019) is common but not universal. Evaluation: Typically presumptive. Treatment is the test; start fluconazole and consider EGD if symptoms do not improve after several days (in which case candidiasis may be severe, or it might not be the cause) Management: Fluconazole; nystatin is ineffective, especially in the severely immunocompromised - Herpes simplex esophagitis Evaluation: EGD shows diffuse ulcerations throughout the esophagus; in severe disease ulcers may coalesce into dark patches, \u201cblack esophagus.\u201d Esophageal biopsy is definitive, but can infer based on EGD appearance and serum studies. Management: Similar to other mucocutaneous infections, consider IV acyclovir at first and transition to PO once clinically improved - CMV esophagitis/enteritis/colitis Presentation: GI bleeding (colitis) or dysphagia and odynophagia (esophagitis) Evaluation: serum CMV PCR, consult GI for consideration of EGD/colonoscopy Management: (val)ganciclovir, foscarnet if ganciclovir resistance or contraindication - Chronic (>1 mo) intestinal isosporiasis Evaluation: Stool ova/parasite can capture Iospora belli (new name Cystoisospora belli), may need serial analysis due to intermittent shedding. Oocysts may also be seen on duodenal biopsy. Management: Bactrim; pyrimethamine + leucovorin if Bactrim is contraindicated - Chronic intestinal cryptosporidiosis Presentation: Diarrhea; may infect respiratory tract, causing nonproductive cough Evaluation: on GiPP or Cryptosporidium Ag Management: Early initiation or optimization of ART; Monotherapy with nitazoxanide is preferred; raising CD4 count >100 is necessary to cure infection - Recurrent salmonella septicemia Generally sensitive to fluoroquinolones, but if not clinically improving as expected you can request sensitivities from the microbiology lab. Neoplastic - Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma - Burkitt\u2019s, immunoblastic (subset of DLBCL), and 1\u00ba CNS - Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma Presentation: Distinctive mucocutaneous lesions, usually raised, papular, violaceous or darkly colored, non-tender and non-pruritic. Can also involve the visceral organs (esp lungs and GI tract) and deep lymphatic system. Evaluation: clinical, tissue biopsy for staging, HHV-8 serum PCR. Management: Limited mucocutaneous disease may resolve with initiation/optimization of ART, but widespread or resistant disease may require additional local therapies (ex radiation) or systemic chemo Bacillary angiomatosis (caused by Bartonella) may present similarly, but can be distinguished from KS on biopsy. It is neither a cancer nor an AIDS defining clinical condition, and is usually treated with doxycycline. - Cervical cancer Presentation, diagnosis, and treatment are essentially the same as in HIV-negative patients, but incidence is higher and disease progression is often more rapid Multisystem/Miscellaneous - Extrapulmonary or disseminated Mycobacterial infection (TB and non-TB) TB can go everywhere; some notable extrapulmonary sites include lymph nodes (e.g., scrofula), bones and joints (e.g., Pott\u2019s disease of the spine), pleura and pericardium, GU tract, and CNS. Dx can come from tissue culture and sometimes MTB PCR for more rapid detection (needs ID approval). TB-IRIS may be severe (esp with high infection burden) and hard to distinguish from TB treatment failure; can also be seen in adequately treated TB (provoked by the presence of dead bacteria) and undiagnosed latent TB. Disseminated MAC is usually diagnosed with AFB blood culture (only 1 positive needed). Think about it in patients with uncontrolled HIV and severe immunosuppression (esp CD4 \\<50), with unintentional weight loss, chronic diarrhea and/or dyspnea, and evidence of GI malabsorption or with bone marrow suppression - Extrapulmonary or disseminated Histoplasmosis, Cryptococcocosis, and Coccidiodomycosis Can be difficult to distinguish based on clinical presentation and imaging alone. Diagnosed by culture and/or antigen testing depending on the organism and site of infection, and diagnosis may be supported by serologic studies.

Evaluation Assessment of urinary symptoms UA + reflex urine Cx (Cx if pt is admitted or has recurrent UTIs) Non -reflex urine Cx: pregnant pts, neutropenia, and pts undergoing urologic procedures Management Empiric therapy Nitrofurantoin monohydrate: 100 mg PO BID x 5 days (avoid if any concern for pyelonephritis or if creatinine clearance \\<60) Cephalexin 250-500mg q6h x5-7 days Alternative therapies Fosfomycin: 3 grams of powder mixed in water as a single PO dose (avoid if any concern for ascending UTI or pyelonephritis). Susceptibility test results must be requested of micro lab and are only possible for E. coli and E. Faecalis. Amoxicillin -clavulanate: 500mg PO BID x5 days Ciprofloxacin : 250mg PO BID x3 days FQ\u2019s should be reserved for more serious infections than uncomplicated cystitis, and only after susceptibility results are confirmed given high rates of resistance from overuse (~25% of E. coli are resistant to ciprofloxacin at VUMC) Adverse effect profile >> beta-lactams (i.e. QT-prolongation, tendinopathies) Additional Information MDR cystitis: ESBL isolates are increasingly common due to antibiotic overuse Before treating, decide if this is a TRUE UTI If true, then for uncomplicated cystitis with ESBL organism, consider Fosfomycin (if E. coli ) or nitrofurantoin (if susceptibility is confirmed \u2013 K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp are usually resistant), or ID consultation Ask the lab to check susceptibility results to these antibiotics, for the future reference Complicated UTI and Pyelonephritis Background Fever , pyuria, and costovertebral angle tenderness suggest pyelonephritis. If any of the following are present, it is also considered a complicated UTI UTI with any of the following present: Renal calculi or other obstructive disease, Immunosuppressed host, abnormal urological anatomy or physiology, presence of a urinary catheter Evaluation - UA with reflex urine culture BCx and UCx prior to antibiotics If there is no pyuria, consider an alternative diagnosis, or proximal ureteral obstruction Pyuria is common in the presence of a urinary catheter, kidney stones, urostomy, ileal conduit and other invasive devices, and may not indicate infection Management Duration: 7-14 days, depending on antibiotic choice Follow up culture to confirm clearance, especially if outpatient Tailor therapy once/if cultures are available. If no improvement in 48h, consider imaging to rule out complications (e.g., perinephric abscess) 0 1 2 NaN First Line Alternative Outpatient Ciprofloxacin 750 BID (or 500 BID if bacteremia r/o) x 7d NaN Inpatient - CTX 2g q24h - Cefepime 2g q8h - Meropenem 2g q8h (if h/o or confirmed ESBL w/in last 90 d) - Ertapenem 1g q24 instead of Meropenem if no Pseudomonas - Ciprofloxacin 750 PO BID (500 PO BID if bacteremia ruled out) OR 400 IV BID (if suscept confirmed)* *FQ\u2019s have same bioavailability if given PO or IV so oral is preferred Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) Background Culture growth of > 10 3 cfu/mL of uropathogenic bacteria + signs or symptoms consistent with infection (without another identified etiology) + indwelling urethral/suprapubic catheter or intermittent catheterization. This includes pts with catheters in place during the preceding 48 hours Duration = greatest risk factor (Increases 3-10% per day of catheterization) Other risks: female sex, diabetes, elderly, colonization of catheter bag, poor care Bacteriuria, foul odor, pyuria, urine appearance and/or bacteriuria alone are not indicative of infection in patients who are otherwise asymptomatic. Ensure clean sample collected Ideally, catheter is removed and midstream sample obtained If catheterization required; removal of old catheter and sample taken from new Management - Distinguish uncomplicated vs complicated UTI (see above) Antimicrobial management: Guided by cultures and susceptibilities Empiric guidance as per management of uncomplicated/complicated UTI and per prior culture data/susceptibilities when available Duration: 7 \u2013 14 days depending on antibiotic, clinical response and whether infection constitutes complicated vs uncomplicated UTI Special note regarding Candida UTI management: Candida Is generally not pathogenic Presence in urine does not indicate infection (unless perinephric abscess, renal transplant, or complex fistulous disease) Fluconazole achieves excellent urinary penetration Echinocandins do not, and other azoles are not well studied in UTIs If fluconazole resistant Candida cultured or suspected, consult ID Susceptibilities are not routinely run on Candida from urine cultures and would need to be requested if concern for true infection. Catheter management At the least, catheters should be replaced at the time of antibiotic initiation Preferably, catheters should be removed If catheterization is necessary, intermittent catheterization is preferred over continuous use.

CPT Codes: Current Procedural Terminology Codes: Numeric codes assigned to every task and service a physician may provide to a patient including medical, surgical, and diagnostic services. They are used by insurers to determine the amount of reimbursement that a practitioner will receive. E&M Codes: Evaluation and Management Codes. These are a category of CPT codes and are the most frequently used. There are different levels of E&M codes, which are determined by the complexity of a patient visit and documentation requirements. Example: 99204 (new patient, level 4) or 99213 (established patient, level 3). Preventive Service Codes: A category of CPT codes used for annual wellness exams. Example: 99395 (established patient, age 18-40). Problem Oriented Visits Return and new patients for which you are mainly addressing one or more acute or chronic problems should be filed under an E&M code. Documentation for these visits only need to include what you as a physician think is medically appropriate.

They are used by insurers to determine the amount of reimbursement that a practitioner will receive. E&M Codes: Evaluation and Management Codes. These are a category of CPT codes and are the most frequently used. There are different levels of E&M codes, which are determined by the complexity of a patient visit and documentation requirements. Example: 99204 (new patient, level 4) or 99213 (established patient, level 3). Preventive Service Codes: A category of CPT codes used for annual wellness exams. Example: 99395 (established patient, age 18-40). Problem Oriented Visits Return and new patients for which you are mainly addressing one or more acute or chronic problems should be filed under an E&M code. Documentation for these visits only need to include what you as a physician think is medically appropriate. The correct E&M code for the visit will depend on three categories: (1) medical complexity, (2) level of risk with testing/treatment, and (3) the amount/complexity of data reviewed. To meet criteria for a given code, the visit must meet the criteria in at least 2 of the 3 aforementioned categories. 0 1 2 Code 99213 (Established) or 99203 (New) - you will sometimes have a level 3 visit when addressing only one problem or providing no prescriptions Code 99213 (Established) or 99203 (New) -

Biopsychosocial factors must be addressed. Examples include anxiety/depression, physical debility, and poor social support. Many pts will not be completely free of pain, so it is important to set realistic boundaries and goals along with each individual. Central sensitization is a phenomenon where the nervous system persists in a state of high reactivity which lowers the threshold for pain stimuli. Two characteristics of centralized pain are allodynia (pain from non-painful stimuli) and hyperalgesia (painful stimuli perceived as more painful). You must ask \u201cwhy does this particular patient have pain?\u201d Cancer patient vs degenerative disc disease will have different therapeutic plans. Pharmacologic Therapy Acetaminophen : 650mg q6hr or 1g q8h. \\<3g/day. (\\<2g in liver patients) Avoid if you are worried about masking fevers. NSAIDs : A great option for acute pain, especially musculoskeletal, HA, and nephrolithiasis in eligible patients (ex: IV/po ketorolac, ibuprofen, naproxen, etc) Avoid in acute or chronic kidney disease and \u2191 risk of bleeding. Caution in CAD/PVD Topical Analgesics Best for localized pain but utilized frequently as part of a multimodal regimen Lidocaine ointment, patches (PADR needed at VA for patches. Can get by saying contraindication to TCA/gabapentinoids/SNRIs due to sedation risk) Menthol salicylate gel Diclofenac Gel (PADR needed at VA) Capsaicin gel Morphine gel (typically limited to oncology patients with tumor breakdown through skin) Neuropathic Agents : Best for neuropathic pain but can be tried for other chronic pain or as part of acute pain regimen. SNRIs and TCAs can provide additional benefit if a pt has comorbid depression, anxiety or insomnia (TCA). Most agents take 6-8 weeks for peak effect. Gabapentin (Initial: 100 to 300 mg 1 to 3 times daily). Can be used for acute pain. Pregabalin (Initial: 25 to 150 mg/day in 2 to 3 divided doses). Has better bioavailability. May work in patients who did not tolerate or did not have success with gabapentin. Duloxetine ( Initial: 30 mg daily for 1 to 2 weeks, then increase to 60 mg daily as tolerated) Amitriptyline ( Initial: 10 to 25 mg once daily at bedtime) Muscle Relaxants : Should be used temporarily and intermittently but some benefit from longer term use. Great for paraplegia, spinal injury, spasticity. Methocarbamol (Initial: 1.5 g 3 to 4 times daily for 2 to 3 days then decrease dose to \u22644.5 g/day in 3 to 4 divided doses). Preferred initial agent as has least SE. Tizanidine ( Initial: 2 to 4 mg every 6 to 12 hours as needed and/or at bedtime ) \u2013 important to watch out for withdrawal in patients that take frequently at home. Cyclobenzaprine (Initial: 5 to 10 mg once daily before bedtime) Metaxalone (Oral: 800 mg 3 to 4 times daily) Opioids: Frequently used in hospital for acute pain. Limit use as much as possible in chronic pain as contributes to long-term central sensitization. May benefit some patient populations but should always be used as a component of a comprehensive, multimodal, patient-specific treatment plan. Refer to section under Opioids: General Principles & Conversions for OME equivalents If > 80 OME per day, ensure patient is prescribed naloxone If >120 OME per day, refer to pain clinic Common choices for acute pain in hospital (always start at low end for opioid na\u00efve): Oxycodone (PO) 5-10mg q4 to 6 hours prn Hydromorphone (IV) 0.25 to 1mg q2 to 3 hours prn For pts on opioids at home, should always continue in hospital to avoid withdrawal unless clinically contraindicated (e.g., respiratory depression). Can always titrate dose as needed Tramadol : Has opioid & NSAID properties. Of note, tramadol also inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 so there is variability between patients. Typical dose: 25 to 50mg q4 to 6 hours prn. NMDA Antagonists Usually prescribed by our pain management colleagues but worthwhile to think about as a potential option if a patient\u2019s pain continues to be difficult to control. Ketamine (IV infusion). SE includes AMS/delirium, hallucinations, and dissociation. Memantine (PO) Alpha 2 agonists (central pain) Not commonly utilized in everyday practice, but helpful in certain patients with chronic pain (off-label). Guanfacine vs clonidine Non-pharmacologic therapies Procedural Intervention Best utilized when there is a specific, targetable Referral to chronic/interventional pain management (Nerve blocks or Radio-ablative therapy) Adjunct Therapies Patient\u2019s will have varying opinions and responses on adjunctive therapies, but these can be as important as any pharmacologic therapy. CBT, personalized exercise regimen, PT/OT, chiropractor, acupuncture Additional Resources for Residents Pain Management Center at VUMC Pain Clinic at the VA. Would specify whether or not you are OK with them initiating opioids. Osher Center for Integrative Health at Vanderbilt. (VA pts may utilize this service if they have private insurance) Acute pain for special populations Renal dysfunction Check meds are renally dosed and start with non-sedating options. Always avoid NSAIDs, morphine and codeine. Acetaminophen and topicals are safe. Opioids: oxycodone 2.5 to 5 mg, IV dilaudid 0.25-0.5mg, fentanyl IV 25 to 50mcg Gabapentin: start with spot 100mg. Be extremely careful with quick uptitration in CKD due to sedation risk.

Biopsychosocial factors must be addressed. Examples include anxiety/depression, physical debility, and poor social support. Many pts will not be completely free of pain, so it is important to set realistic boundaries and goals along with each individual. Central sensitization is a phenomenon where the nervous system persists in a state of high reactivity which lowers the threshold for pain stimuli. Two characteristics of centralized pain are allodynia (pain from non-painful stimuli) and hyperalgesia (painful stimuli perceived as more painful). You must ask \u201cwhy does this particular patient have pain?\u201d Cancer patient vs degenerative disc disease will have different therapeutic plans. Pharmacologic Therapy Acetaminophen : 650mg q6hr or 1g q8h. \\<3g/day. (\\<2g in liver patients) Avoid if you are worried about masking fevers. NSAIDs : A great option for acute pain, especially musculoskeletal, HA, and nephrolithiasis in eligible patients (ex: IV/po ketorolac, ibuprofen, naproxen, etc) Avoid in acute or chronic kidney disease and \u2191 risk of bleeding. Caution in CAD/PVD Topical Analgesics Best for localized pain but utilized frequently as part of a multimodal regimen Lidocaine ointment, patches (PADR needed at VA for patches. Can get by saying contraindication to TCA/gabapentinoids/SNRIs due to sedation risk) Menthol salicylate gel Diclofenac Gel (PADR needed at VA) Capsaicin gel Morphine gel (typically limited to oncology patients with tumor breakdown through skin) Neuropathic Agents : Best for neuropathic pain but can be tried for other chronic pain or as part of acute pain regimen. SNRIs and TCAs can provide additional benefit if a pt has comorbid depression, anxiety or insomnia (TCA). Most agents take 6-8 weeks for peak effect. Gabapentin (Initial: 100 to 300 mg 1 to 3 times daily). Can be used for acute pain. Pregabalin (Initial: 25 to 150 mg/day in 2 to 3 divided doses). Has better bioavailability. May work in patients who did not tolerate or did not have success with gabapentin. Duloxetine ( Initial: 30 mg daily for 1 to 2 weeks, then increase to 60 mg daily as tolerated) Amitriptyline ( Initial: 10 to 25 mg once daily at bedtime) Muscle Relaxants : Should be used temporarily and intermittently but some benefit from longer term use. Great for paraplegia, spinal injury, spasticity. Methocarbamol (Initial: 1.5 g 3 to 4 times daily for 2 to 3 days then decrease dose to \u22644.5 g/day in 3 to 4 divided doses). Preferred initial agent as has least SE. Tizanidine ( Initial: 2 to 4 mg every 6 to 12 hours as needed and/or at bedtime ) \u2013 important to watch out for withdrawal in patients that take frequently at home. Cyclobenzaprine (Initial: 5 to 10 mg once daily before bedtime) Metaxalone (Oral: 800 mg 3 to 4 times daily) Opioids: Frequently used in hospital for acute pain. Limit use as much as possible in chronic pain as contributes to long-term central sensitization. May benefit some patient populations but should always be used as a component of a comprehensive, multimodal, patient-specific treatment plan. Refer to section under Opioids: General Principles & Conversions for OME equivalents If > 80 OME per day, ensure patient is prescribed naloxone If >120 OME per day, refer to pain clinic Common choices for acute pain in hospital (always start at low end for opioid na\u00efve): Oxycodone (PO) 5-10mg q4 to 6 hours prn Hydromorphone (IV) 0.25 to 1mg q2 to 3 hours prn For pts on opioids at home, should always continue in hospital to avoid withdrawal unless clinically contraindicated (e.g., respiratory depression). Can always titrate dose as needed Tramadol : Has opioid & NSAID properties. Of note, tramadol also inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 so there is variability between patients. Typical dose: 25 to 50mg q4 to 6 hours prn. NMDA Antagonists Usually prescribed by our pain management colleagues but worthwhile to think about as a potential option if a patient\u2019s pain continues to be difficult to control. Ketamine (IV infusion). SE includes AMS/delirium, hallucinations, and dissociation. Memantine (PO) Alpha 2 agonists (central pain) Not commonly utilized in everyday practice, but helpful in certain patients with chronic pain (off-label). Guanfacine vs clonidine Non-pharmacologic therapies Procedural Intervention Best utilized when there is a specific, targetable Referral to chronic/interventional pain management (Nerve blocks or Radio-ablative therapy) Adjunct Therapies Patient\u2019s will have varying opinions and responses on adjunctive therapies, but these can be as important as any pharmacologic therapy.

Would specify whether or not you are OK with them initiating opioids. Osher Center for Integrative Health at Vanderbilt. (VA pts may utilize this service if they have private insurance) Acute pain for special populations Renal dysfunction Check meds are renally dosed and start with non-sedating options. Always avoid NSAIDs, morphine and codeine. Acetaminophen and topicals are safe. Opioids: oxycodone 2.5 to 5 mg, IV dilaudid 0.25-0.5mg, fentanyl IV 25 to 50mcg Gabapentin: start with spot 100mg. Be extremely careful with quick uptitration in CKD due to sedation risk.

Inquire as to which family is present prior to entering, including whether the POA is currently at bedside. Be aware of the circumstances of the patient\u2019s death, particularly whether death was expected or sudden. In general, it is best to enter accompanied, ideally with the patient\u2019s nurse. It is rare for the chaplain to be present but that might also be a consideration. Inquire with the nurse if Tennessee Donor Services (TDS) has been notified; often, when death is anticipated, the nurse will already have done this, although that is not always the case. Remember that it is not your position/role to approach the family regarding organ donation, but TDS should have been notified and there should be a case number, which in Epic you will have to document. In The Room: Especially when cross-covering, make sure to introduce yourself to family, and allow them time to introduce themselves to you.

Note the location of a working clock when you enter; your watch is ok too but do make sure to avoid looking at your smartphone to check the time of death. The Exam And Pronouncement: Identify the patient by wrist band. Note general appearance. Confirm that the patient does not respond to stimuli; one discreet way to confirm a lack of response to tactile stimuli is to hold the hand, and apply pressure to a nailbed, appearing to hold the hand while looking at/visually inspecting the face or other part of the body. You should avoid any obvious painful stimuli, out of respect for the deceased as well as out of deference to family who may be present. Confirm the absence of spontaneous respirations. Confirm the absence of heart sounds. Examine the pupils and note the absence of pupillary light reflex. Note the time at which your examination is completed. This is the time of death. It is ok (although not required; this is merely a consideration) to speak the time of death quietly and respectfully, for the family\u2019s reference as well as staff\u2019s.

For example, 1 mg of IV morphine is equal to 3 mg of oral morphine. When transitioning, doses are traditionally reduced by \u00bc to \u2153 due to cross tolerance. (Oxycodone 5 is a pretty standard dose, which converts to 7.5 mg of oral morphine, 2.5 mg of iv morphine, and 0.375 of iv hydromorphone.) Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCAs) aka Pain Pumps: Pumps can be programmed to deliver a continuous rate and/or a bolus dose. The basal rate is a continuous infusion dosed per hour that cannot be adjusted by the patient. The demand dose is a patient-directed bolus that is given at a prescribed frequency (whenever the pt presses the button). Both the actual dose and frequency of bolus dose can be adjusted. The general rule of thumb is to calculate the total OME delivered through the demand when a pt is in steady state and convert 75% of this dose into the total continuous rate or basal infusion. Alternatively, if a pt is chronically on a long-acting opioid, this total amount of OME (sustained release) can be converted into a basal rate of opioid. The demand dose is 25% of the hourly rate given every 15 minutes. Remember that the basal rate will not get to steady state for at least 8 hrs; therefore, when you admit pts or are transitioning pts to a PCA, always initiate the PCA pump with a bolus (or loading) dose.

If it does not display info about PCA, hit \u201cChannel Select\u201d on PCA Select \u201cOptions\u201d in bottom left of IV pump Select \u201cPatient History\u201d on the left of the screen. This shows the administration history for a certain time period (e.g., 24h, 12h, 4h, etc) Hit \u201cZoom\u201d on bottom of screen to change time period to 24 hours. Should show: Total Drug: total amount of drug received in last 24 hours Total Demands: amount of times the pt has pushed the button for demand dose Delivered : amount of times the pt actually received a demand dose The difference between \u201cTotal Demands\u201d and \u201cDelivered\u201d is the number of times the patient pushed the button without receiving a dose (due to pushing the button during the lockout interval). If you have questions about interrogating the PCA, ask the nurses! They are a great resource! Opioid Side effects Constipation: dose-dependent and will not develop tolerance. If pt has opioids, they need robust bowel regimen (miralax, senna) with goal of BM \u2265 every 3 days. For opioid-specific constipation can do SQ Relistor (methylnaltrexone) but this is expensive and can only be given in the PCU or oncology floors at VUMC. For patients with chronic opioid-induced constipation as an outpatient can trial oral agents like Movantik (naloxgeol). Can also consider PO naloxone but it does have small amount of bioavailability so watch for systemic reversal. Nausea: occurs with opiate na\u00efve pts. Consider starting an anti-emetic concurrently. Most pts will develop tachyphylaxis with this over a day, so the antiemetic can be discontinued. Urinary retention: Consider role of opioids in pts with new-onset or worsening urinary retention. Try to de-escalate opioid dosing if possible. Overdose: In pts with apneic emergency, IV 0.4 mg Naloxone; however, low threshold for multiple doses until response. With respiratory depression in chronic opioid pts start with IV 0.02 mg q2-3min to avoid profound withdrawal. This helps prevent acute pain crisis. In pts taking long-acting opioids, may need to redose q30min and consider IV infusion for them. For pts prescribed opioids as outpatient, need naloxone 4 mg intransasal. Pruritis: due to histamine release from mast cells; can be treated with antihistamines. The opioid can also be rotated. Some but not all pts will develop tachyphylaxis to this symptom. Toxicity: hyperalgesia and neuroexcitatory effects (AMS, myoclonic jerking, seizures). Risk factors for neuroexcitatory effects are rapid titration, dehydration or renal failure.","title":"Opiate Principles"},{"location":"pain-and-palliative/pain-and-palliative-opiate-principles/#opiate-principles","text":"Opioids: General Principles & Conversion \u2013 Brian Grieb Oral Morphine Equivalent (OME) Conversion Table: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Drug PO IV APAP IR ER Notes Tramadol 0.1x - - Tramadol Ultram ER\u2122 NSAID properties Morphine 1x 3x - Morphine IR MS-Contin\u2122 Renally cleared Hydrocodone 1x NaN Lortab Hydrocodone NaN NaN Oxycodone 1.5x - Percocet Roxicodone\u2122 Oxycontin\u2122 NaN Hydromorphone 4x 20x - IV, Oral - Oral is $ Fentanyl 300x 300x - IV\u2019 Buccal, Nasal Patch Dosed in ug, not mg Abbreviations: ER, extended release; IR, immediate release; IV, intravenous; PO, oral; APAP, Acetaminophen Conversion: Transition between opiates is done using oral morphine equivalents (OMEs), in which each drugs\u2019 potency is compared to oral morphine (see table).

also available in q30d IM Monitor liver enzymes; AST/ALT must be \\< 3-5x ULN Acamprosate (cannot be used in severe renal impairment) Head-to-head, inferior to naltrexone (see COMBINE trial) 333 mg TID, titrating to 666 mg TID dosing Difficult TID dosing may be helpful if framed as commitment/mindfulness practice Disulfiram Infrequently used outside of extreme motivation (e.g. professional under monitoring); would not use outside specialist care Must abstain from alcohol ~2 weeks after last dose, given risk of disulfiram-ethanol reaction (DER), which can be fatal depending upon disulfiram and ethanol doses Topiramate Not FDA-approved for AUD, but has significant supporting evidence Useful for individuals without abstinence goal Titrate slowly over 8 weeks to 200-300 mg/d Gabapentin : Not FDA-approved for AUD, but with some evidence Useful for post-acute withdrawal anxiety, insomnia, or co-occurring neuropathy Titrate to 900-1800 mg/d divided into TID dosing, monitoring for sedation Risk of sedation/apnea if concomitant alcohol use;

I.e. if the pt is on 12/5 the mask will deliver a pressure of 12 when breathing in and 5 when breathing out. 12/5 is a good start, in comments write \u201cauto-titrate\u201d and the RT will have some leeway to change settings Immediate pharmacotherapy, in tandem with diagnostics and airway mgmt Circulation For hemodynamic instability, HR \\< 50, call anesthesia for immediate rapid sequence intubation (RSI). Pt\u2019s can be hypotensive for a host of reasons including pneumothorax, sepsis, circulatory collapse from hypoxia and bradycardia, etc. Subsequent Workup: Continuous pulse oximetry, ABG/VBG, EKG, CXR, CBC, BMP, troponin, BNP (if considering HF dx), Sputum cx, consider blood cx if concern for sepsis, rapid flu. Lung Ultrasound to differentiate COPD from pulmonary edema when a pt presents with wheezing and respiratory failure (pulmonary edema will have Kerley B lines) During evaluation, consider triggers for COPD exacerbation: viral infection (70%), PNA, PE. Have a high index of suspicion for PE in these pts . Management Manage airway as above - many pts will need BiPAP if severe respiratory distress or hypercapnia are present Bronchodilators Order \u201cRespiratory Care Therapy Management Protocol\u201d at VUMC When ordered, an RT evaluates the pt and based on physical exam will give a duoneb The RT will then continue to assess the pt based on severity of the exacerbation If ordering bronchodilators individually (this is discouraged) order: Albuterol 2.5 mg diluted to 3 mL via nebulizer or 4 to 8 inhalations from MDI every 4 hours while awake (RT), or more frequently if needed Ipratropium 500 mcg via nebulizer, or 4-8 inhalations from MDI q 4 hrs while awake Can additionally order \"duoneb\" at VUMC There is no respiratory order protocol at the VA, order individually as above. RT is available to assess if needed Steroids For severe exacerbation give methylprednisolone 125 mg IV BID (or 60mg IV q6h) For moderate to mild COPD exacerbations give prednisone 40mg PO daily for 5 days (including the initial IV dose if pt received one in the ER) Antibiotics Benefit less clear in mild to moderate exacerbations Azithromycin 500mg x 1 then 250mg daily for 4 days or doxycycline 200 mg BID if concern for QT prolongation. Can also consider Levaquin 750mg PO daily for 5 days, however this is often too broad for a standard COPD exacerbation. Refer to \u201cPneumonia\u201d if treating a separate PNA in addition to COPD Discharge Planning: Teaching on medication compliance and appropriate use. Ensure pt has a spacer Pulmonary Rehab Vaccinations (see outpatient management COPD in handbook) Controller medications/inhalers (see outpatient management COPD in handbook) Exacerbation Action plans: No consensus as to what the components should be, but instead a patient-specific plan can be made should the pt\u2019s symptoms recur","title":"COPD Exacerbation Management"},{"location":"pulmonary/pulmonary-cxrs/","text":"CXRs \u00b6 0 How to Interpret Chest Radiographs (CXR) \u2013 Gautam Babu An X-ray is a density-gram where \u201cwhite\u201d is \u201cdense\u201d and \u201cblack\u201d is \u201cnot dense\u201d.

See other sections for information relevant to particular diagnoses If acutely decompensating, Duonebs, IV lasix, Antibiotics depending on clinical picture Supplemental O2 for goal SpO2: >90-92% for most patients (There is generally no need to make SpO2 100%) Between 88-92% for patients with chronic hypoxia from COPD (i.e., on home O2)","title":"Hypoxia"},{"location":"pulmonary/pulmonary-ild/","text":"ILD \u00b6 0 Interstitial Lung Disease \u2013 Gaby Schroeder Background MANY CAUSES, one mnemonic to use: S arcoidosis H ypersensitivity Pneumonitis I diopathic Interstitial Pneumonias (IIPs- UIP/IPF, NSIP, OP, RB-ILD, DIP, LIP, AIP) T uberculosis F ungal A spiration/ Asbestosis (and other Pneumoconiosis) C onnective Tissue Disease + Cancer E osinophilic Pneumonia D rugs Evaluation History: Ask about 1) Duration, timing, severity of primary respiratory symptoms 2) Exposures: Pets, Occupation, Residence, Mold, Feathers, Smoking, Illicits, Travel, Hobbies, Medications (especially amiodarone, nitrofurantoin and chemotherapies) 3) Symptoms of systemic autoimmune disease 4) Family history Chest Imaging: HRCT is best for characterization, but often not achievable or desirable in inpatient setting when patients are critically ill.

If still no output, CT w/ IV contrast to re-evaluate area of the drain, then page 835-0770 (Body Procedures) for abscess drains or page 835-5105 (Vascular IR) for rec\u2019s regarding PCNs, PTCs, or G-tubes. If an abscess drain is malfunctioning, first ensure proper suction/3-way direction. Next instill tPA into the catheter for 2 hours. Epic order: \u201cAlteplase (TPA) injection/infusion options\u201d -> Percutaneous drainage -> 2mg or 4mg (20mL or 40mL, 1mg/10mL concentration). Reach out to Body Procedures service (835-0770) with any questions. If drain is at an operative site, confirm drain tPA is acceptable by surgery team. If this doesn\u2019t improve output in 48 hours, consider repositioning drain (VIR consult).","title":"Consults for Radiology

This is a goal completion date, and this is a project of the US Government. CPRS skills are likely to be useful for a good while yet. Shortcuts \u00b6 CPRS has a rather staggering amount of keyboard shortcuts. The full list is available in this pdf . Task management \u00b6 One of the beautiful and awful things about CPRS is that it is self-contained. It does not interface with the outside world - no push notifications, no easy way to check things on your phone. Within its walled garden, it is also not easy to figure out what has been done and what needs doing. There are a few approaches to task management more-or-less built into CPRS. Tracker Reminder Notes \u00b6 One of the available note types is called \"Tracker Reminder.\" These are unsignable notes (try to sign one and it will fail), that remain in your inbox until deleted. They are a great way to prechart, and you can use them to make notes to yourself about whatever. No one else, including your preceptor, can see what's in them (maybe there's some way for some admin to introspect them, but I haven't heard of anyone who both knows how to do this and cares to look at your personal scribblings). I used to also use them as a general to-do list, and I know some residents live by them throughout training. I don't use them as a catch-all anymore (instead preferring Ticklers, outlined below), and now essentially only use them for pre-charting. In your inbox, all you can see is the patient for whom you have a Tracker Reminder, and the note title (\"UNSIGNED Tracker Reminder\") - there is no good way to differentiate between a precharted note, a to-do item, or anything else you may have written. CPRS is very slow, so clicking into each Tracker Reminder to see what's in there is much too expensive in terms of time. Ticklers \u00b6 Yes, self-assigned alerts in CPRS are called \"Ticklers.\" Because \"Alerts\" is not nearly descriptive enough. To set up Ticklers for yourself, get into a new note or make an addendum. (shout out to Paige, RN extraordinaire, for showing me her approach - it's A-OK to make an addendum with the content of only \"setting alert\") Click \"Templates\" on the bottom left. The first \"Shared Template\" should have the word \"Tickler.\" Double-click it, and it will open up a simple dialogue that asks you when you want to be alerted, and any text you would like within the alert. Then, when the time comes for that alert, it will show up in your universal CPRS inbox. When you click into it, it will show you the text you entered, and give you three options - copy the text of the alert to the clipboard, renew the alert, or close it out. One advantage to this approach over a huge list of Tracker Reminder notes is that your inbox does not become nearly as cluttered, and you can tell more easily what is time-sensitive. I also prefer it over some third-party solution, such as a OneNote page, Word doc, or Excel sheet (all HIPAA-compliant if using your institutional OneDrive account), because all of my VA work and data lives in a single system, so I don't have something else to (forget to) check. Leave-one-behind alert method \u00b6 The most common scenario: see a patient, order some studies. Study results roll in, you need to discuss next steps with the patient. Something is still processing, and/or you don't have time right now to have a phone call. Instead of leaving 6 or 7 alerts for the same person cluttering your inbox, remove all but one (highlight the alerts you want to get rid of and click \"Remove\"). That lone remaining alert functions as a reminder. When the stars align, click into that alert, go through all the recent results, and communicate however makes sense for the situation. Remote Access QoL \u00b6 Text expansion \u00b6 One of the best categories of quality-of-life improvements you can make for using CPRS remotely is text expansion/macros. On Windows, PhraseExpress is great. On Mac, aText is also great. Set up an expansion to [enter your passcode (123456) and hit \"Enter\"]. I have it set to ,c . (I have ,e mapped to my Epic password). This saves so much time and hassle. For example, to sign a note, I hit Ctrl+Shift+g to open the \"Sign Note\" dialog (this is a built-in CPRS shortcut), then I tap ,c , and the note is signed. Takes far less than a second, fingers stay close to home row. The VA made their own tool to do this, called \"CPRSBooster\" (it's somewhere under the Star folder on every desktop). It works. The main utility of CPRSBooster is to give you ideas for other text expansions you could set up, such as your nurse's name for tagging on notes. VistA \u00b6 VistA is the (rather insane) software and database system that undergirds CPRS. I get the sense that the deepest magicks rest in VistA, waiting for the intrepid explorer, seeking a grail filled with automated data extraction and sane clinical workflows. The documentation is scattered. This is one of the official sources. I've only taken a cursory look, but it seems less technical and mostly snarky. There's also a wiki devoted to VistA, though it is not restricted to the official USGovt version (since the software is federally mandated to be open source, it has been forked and developed in several countries worldwide). If you have been inducted into the cult of VistA, and need an acolyte, let me know. I make pretty kickass chocolate chip cookies.","title":"CPRS"},{"location":"zCBH/cprs/#cprs","text":"FYI, the Cerner transition has a goal completion date of 2028.

When the stars align, click into that alert, go through all the recent results, and communicate however makes sense for the situation.","title":"Leave-one-behind alert method"},{"location":"zCBH/cprs/#remote-access-qol","text":"","title":"Remote Access QoL"},{"location":"zCBH/cprs/#text-expansion","text":"One of the best categories of quality-of-life improvements you can make for using CPRS remotely is text expansion/macros. On Windows, PhraseExpress is great. On Mac, aText is also great. Set up an expansion to [enter your passcode (123456) and hit \"Enter\"]. I have it set to ,c . (I have ,e mapped to my Epic password). This saves so much time and hassle. For example, to sign a note, I hit Ctrl+Shift+g to open the \"Sign Note\" dialog (this is a built-in CPRS shortcut), then I tap ,c , and the note is signed. Takes far less than a second, fingers stay close to home row. The VA made their own tool to do this, called \"CPRSBooster\" (it's somewhere under the Star folder on every desktop). It works. The main utility of CPRSBooster is to give you ideas for other text expansions you could set up, such as your nurse's name for tagging on notes.","title":"Text expansion"},{"location":"zCBH/cprs/#vista","text":"VistA is the (rather insane) software and database system that undergirds CPRS. I get the sense that the deepest magicks rest in VistA, waiting for the intrepid explorer, seeking a grail filled with automated data extraction and sane clinical workflows. The documentation is scattered. This is one of the official sources. I've only taken a cursory look, but it seems less technical and mostly snarky. There's also a wiki devoted to VistA, though it is not restricted to the official USGovt version (since the software is federally mandated to be open source, it has been forked and developed in several countries worldwide). If you have been inducted into the cult of VistA, and need an acolyte, let me know. I make pretty kickass chocolate chip cookies.","title":"VistA"}]}
