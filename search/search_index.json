If steroids will be tapered or discontinued soon after, either continue hospital regimen for remainder of steroid course or return to home regimen (hyperglycemia is better than hypoglycemia) Additional Information At the VA, NPH is formulary If a pt takes Lantus at home, this can be continued; otherwise, a PADR is needed. NPH\u2019s duration of action is shorter than Lantus and, in most cases, should be dosed q12h. The conversion is done by taking total Lantus dose and dividing it two doses.

Note: Leukocytosis will be present in DKA, even if infection isn\u2019t the precipitating factor Ischemia (MI, CVA, mesenteric ischemia): EKG, Troponin, CT(A) if clinical suspicion Intoxication - Ethanol (can cause ketosis with or without acidosis), cocaine, MDMA Impregnation - Beta HCG if appropriate Insulin-openia/Iatrogenic: steroids, SGLT2 inhibitors, other meds, insulin delivery failure (pump failure, insulin degraded by heat, etc.) Remember to correct sodium for hyperglycemia (Na + 2.4 mEq * (BG-100)) Management Initial monitoring: q2-4h BMPs (monitor K closely), q1h BG fingersticks Can space less frequently once gap is closed x 2 and patient off insulin infusion Ensure IV access Start IV fluids, insulin, and potassium as below Start insulin gtt Start subcutaneous long-acting insulin as soon as insulin drip/IV insulin is started Either start home long-acting (dose reduce as needed) or if insulin na\u00efve, lantus 0.2-0.3u/kg/day Lactated ringers\u2019 preferred fluid if no contraindication Dextrose should be added when BG \\<200 (or clear liquid diet) Turn off insulin drip when anion gap is closed on two consecutive BMPs Consult endocrinology early Management algorithm on next page (Diabetes Care. 2009 Jul; 32(7): 1335\u20131343) Note: pts are usually deficient in total body potassium even if their serum potassium is high Additional Information Pts on insulin drip can be admitted to stepdown (8MCE) with order set Pts can be admitted to stepdown on a subcutaneous insulin protocol with mild DKA with endocrinology guiding insulin management Avoid ordering C-peptide if concern for new type 1 diabetes, beta islet cells can be \"stunned\" with recent hyperglycemic states and may be falsely low SGLT2 inhibitors, are being prescribed much more often and can cause a euglycemic DKA, where acidosis and ketosis present but no elevated BG Hypothyroidism \u2013 Griffin Bullock Background Elevated TSH and low FT4 (primary hypothyroidism) Hashimoto\u2019s (autoimmune) thyroiditis, iodine deficiency, drugs (amiodarone, dopamine antagonists), adrenal insufficiency, thyroid hormone resistance (genetic), non-thyroidal illness (recovery phase), post-surgery or ablation for hyperthyroidism Elevated TSH and normal FT4: subclinical hypothyroidism Low-Normal TSH, low FT4: central hypothyroidism, sick euthyroid Presentation Often non-specific and vague: fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, myalgia, edema menstrual irregularities, depression, mental dysfunction Goiter, bradycardia, diastolic hypertension, delayed relaxation following reflex testing Lab abnormalities: microcytic anemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyponatremia, elevated CK Evaluation TSH: If elevated repeat TSH and obtain T4 Lipid panel, CBC, BMP Management Treatment required if \u2193 T4, significantly \u2191 TSH (>10), or symptoms with any lab abnormality Titrate therapy to a normal TSH (unless central hypothyroidism, then target free T4 levels) Observation of asymptomatic pts with subclinical hypothyroidism (normal T4, mild \u2191 TSH) Treatment is with formulation of T4 (full replacement is approximately 1.6 mcg/kg/day) Initial Dose: Young/healthy patients: full anticipated dose Older patients or patients with CAD: 25-50 mcg daily Increased doses required for: pregnancy, estrogen therapy, weight gain, PPI therapy, GI disorders (\u2193 absorption), ferrous sulfate therapy Additional information Pts should take Levothyroxine alone, 1 hr prior to eating to ensure appropriate absorption Of note, missed doses can be taken along with the next dose Symptoms improve in 2-3 weeks. TSH steady state requires 6 weeks Dose can be titrated every 6 weeks based on TSH Pregnancy: Pregnancy causes lab changes due to differing levels thyroid binding globulin.

observation is the best approach When pancytopenia is slow, progressive over time, or acute without any other precipitating factors then would consult hematology for consideration of a bone marrow syndromes Leukocytosis \u2013 Kenna Koehler Background Common progenitor cells (stem cells) are located in the bone marrow and give rise to erythrocytes, myeloblasts, megakaryoblasts Normal WBC can vary by age and pregnancy, for the purpose of this section will assume this is for an average, non-pregnant adult Chronic mild neutrophilic leukocytosis (10-20k) is common with tobacco use and obesity, both due to mechanisms related to chronic inflammation Reactive (typically 11k-30k) - surgery, exercise, trauma, burns, emotional stress Leukemoid reaction (typically 50k-100k) - severe infections (fulminant C difficile ), organ rejection If greater than 100k, think leukemia or myeloproliferative disorder Evaluation Neutrophilia (neutrophil count >7k) Bacterial infection, pregnancy, rheumatologic disease, steroids, beta agonists, lithium, colony-stimulating factors, splenectomy or functional asplenia, congenital (hereditary/chronic idiopathic neutrophilia), Down syndrome,

Kenna Koehler Background Includes both deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) and pulmonary embolism (PE). See \u201cPulmonary Embolism\u201d section in cardiology for more information on PEs Risk Factors for Provoked DVT/PE Major risk factors: major surgery >30 minutes, hospitalization > 3 days, C-section Minor Risk Factors: Surgery \\<30 minutes, Hospitalization \\<3 days, pregnancy, estrogen therapy, reduced mobility >3 days Non-transient risk factors: Malignancy (active), IBD, liver disease, hereditary thrombophilia Evaluation Asymmetric calf swelling of >2cm sensitivity and specificity for DVT of 60-70% Wells\u2019 Criteria for DVT can help guide diagnostic testing If a patient has a low pre-test probability, a negative D-dimer can rule out DVT In a high pre-test probability patient a negative D-dimer is less helpful Whole-leg ultrasounds with doppler Management Prophylaxis: Padua score Score > 4 high risk, recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis Subcutaneous Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) or Subcutaneous Heparin Score \\<4 is low risk; recommend ambulation and SCDs Treatment (see anticoagulation section) Subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) Oral factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban) Intravenous unfractionated heparin Warfarin (with bridge therapy) Duration of treatment Provoked: 3 months or until provoking factor (trauma, surgery, malignancy) is removed Unprovoked: Typically requires life-long anticoagulation along with assistance from hematology Anticoagulation in malignancy: LMWH or DOAC (most evidence for apixaban and rivaroxaban) while malignancy still active Avoid rivaroxaban and edoxaban in GI malignancies (increased rates of bleeding) Additional Information Should we get a follow up ultrasound? A follow up ultrasound at the CONCLUSION of anticoagulation can help establish a post-treatment baseline and provide a baseline study for future comparison that can be critical for the diagnosis of recurrent/new DVT (which is very difficult to determine radiographically without a comparison imaging study) What about IVC filters? Select circumstances for these: In patients with acute DVT or PE and in whom anti-coagulation is absolutely contraindicated (thrombocytopenia, recent intra-cranial bleed, recent GI bleed) placement of a retrievable IVC filter should be discussed with Hematology and IR Anticoagulation \u2013 Madeleine Turcotte Agent Treatment Dose Renal Dose Prophylaxis Monitoring Unfractionated heparin 80 U/kg bolus, then 18 U/kg/hr No change necessary 5000 U q8h PTT (automatic in order set) Enoxaparin (Lovenox) 1 mg/kg q12h 1 mg/kg daily 40 mg daily or 30 mg BID LMWH level (anti-Xa level) Best checked 4 h after 4th dose Warfarin (Coumadin) Start 2-5mg daily and monitor INR Can consult Pharmacy No change necessary N/A PT/INR Use Chromogenic Factor X assay if pt has APLS Dabigatran (Pradaxa) After 5 days of a parenteral AC, 150 mg BID Avoid use N/A Can test drug level if concerned (Any DOAC) Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) 15 mg BID x21 d then 20 mg daily Avoid use in CrCl<30 10mg QD Apixaban (Eliquis) 10mg BID x7d, then 5mg BID VTE: No adjustment 2.5 mg BID A Fib: 2.5mg BID, if 2 of the following: Cr 1.5, Age > 80 Weight < 60kg Edoxaban (Savaysa) After 5 days of a parenteral AC, 60 mg daily 30 mg for CrCl 15-50 Avoid if CrCl > 95 Best studied option in renal dysfunction Additional Information VA is starting to move towards rivaroxaban and apixaban for extended secondary thromboprophylaxis Write in your PADR for apixaban citing \u201cpatient uses a pillbox and cannot use dabigatran\u201d Renal dysfunction: favor warfarin, apixaban or edoxaban Hx of GI bleed: avoid dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban (may have higher risk of GI bleed) Pregnancy: UFH/LMWH (other agents may cross the placenta) Transitioning Between Anticoagulants with DOACs LMWH to Warfarin Warfarin and LMWH given simultaneously until INR is therapeutic for 24 hours Warfarin to DOAC Start DOAC when INR \\< 2.0 DOAC to Warfarin High Risk DVT/PE \u2013 start LMWH or UFH, then start Warfarin Low to Moderate Risk DVT/PE \u2013 Start warfarin while patient on DOAC, Stop DOAC on Day 3 of warfarin therapy, Check INR on day 4 LMWH to DOAC Stop LMWH and start DOAC when due for next dose of LMWH (within 2 hrs) DOAC to LMWH Stop DOAC and start LMWH when due for next DOAC dose UFH to DOAC Start DOAC when IV stopped (30 min prior to cessation if high risk for thrombosis) DOAC to UFH Start IV heparin with bolus when next DOAC dose is due Peri-Procedural Management of Anticoagulation Temporary IVC filter indicated in pts with very recent acute VTE (within 3-4 weeks) if the procedure requires AC delay >12 hours For those at high risk of thromboembolism: Consider continuing AC for low-bleeding-risk procedures, i.e. dental procedures, cutaneous biopsy/excision, ICD placement, endovascular procedures.

Hypercoagulability 2. Stasis 3. Endothelial injury Diagnostic thrombophilia testing indications: Idiopathic or recurrent VTE First VTE at \\<40 years old VTE in the setting of strong family history VTE in unusual vascular site (cerebral, renal, mesenteric) Recurrent pregnancy loss Must consider if thrombophilia testing will change clinical management If the unprovoked VTE warrants indefinite anticoagulation then testing may not be helpful However, if VTE provoked by minor risk factor (OCPs) with an underlying thrombophilia might change the decision, then testing may be informative Separated into Acquired and Hereditary conditions: Hereditary: Factor V Leiden mutation, Prothrombin mutation, Protein C or S deficiency, Antithrombin deficiency Acquired: Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APLS) Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) Major surgery/trauma Nephrotic Syndrome Smoking Pregnancy Oral Contraceptives Immobilization (bedridden, hip/knee replacement) Active malignancy Estrogen replacement therapy Note: Travel (plane, train, automobile) is NOT on this list and this is NOT considered a provoking risk factor Testing: all specific testing for hereditary disorders and APS should be performed at least 4-6 weeks after an acute thrombotic event or discontinuation of anticoagulant/thrombolytic therapies to avoid interference Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLS) Background Most common acquired disorder (anti-phospholipid antibodies present in 3-5% population) Recurrent pregnancy loss, provoked DVT in young, unprovoked VTE and arterial thrombosis in young, thrombosis unusual sites, thrombosis in autoimmune disease This is a clinicopathologic diagnosis (need both clinical and laboratory criteria) Evaluation Positive for at least 1 lab criterion on at least 2 occasions, at least 12 weeks apart: Lupus anticoagulant: can occur in relation to drugs or infection; transient are associated with thrombotic risk Anticardiolipin antibodies B2GP1 (anti-beta2-glycoprotein) antibodies Must also meet at least 1 of the following clinical criteria: Vascular thrombosis: DVT, arterial thrombosis, or small vessel thrombosis of any organ Pregnancy loss: there are specific criteria for this \u2013 consult UpToDate or other resource Management Aspirin for primary prevention; warfarin for treatment (INR 2-3) Do NOT use DOACs for triple positive APLS (see TRAPS trial: rivaroxaban inferior to warfarin) Rituximab for recurrent thrombosis despite anticoagulation (controversial) \u2013 call hematology Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) Type 1: Mild and self-limited (not immune-mediated) Occurs within the first 2 days of first-time exposure Platelet count normalizes with continued heparin therapy Type 2 (what we typically refer to as HIT): Immune mediated Fall in plt 30% to over 50% (even if plt count >150) and/or thrombotic event has occurred 4-10 days after new exposure to heparin derivative OR\u2264 1 day after restarting heparin derivative that had been used 30-100 days prior If exposed to heparin within 100 days, will have platelet drop within 24 hr Frequency: unfractionated heparin > LMWH; Surgical wards > medical wards 50% will have thrombotic event in 30 days if HIT is untreated, with 20% mortality Arterial thrombi are common in HIT HIT results from antibodies to complexes of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin, further activating platelets (the activated platelets aggregate causing thrombocytopenia) Evaluation 4T score (0-8 points): Thrombocytopenia (0-2 pts): degree and nadir of platelet count drop Timing (0-2 pts): timing of fall after initial or recurrent heparin exposure Thrombosis (0-2 pts): thrombosis, skin necrosis, non-necrotizing lesions, acute systemic reaction to heparin Other causes of thrombocytopenia (0-2 pts): more points if no alternate cause Solid-phase ELISA for heparin-PF4 antibodies: 0.2-0.4 is indeterminate > 0.4 is positive > 1.4 HIT is likely > 2 confirms HIT The lab at VUMC will perform functional SRA reflexively for all values >0.2 Management 0-3 points: Low concern for HIT;

cost effective Management VTE treatment same as general population VTE 4-8x risk in heterozygotes; 80x risk in homozygotes Avoid OCPs: increased risk for VTE Prothrombin gene mutation Evaluation: PCR of G20210A mutation (2-4% prevalence) Management: VTE treatment same as general population & avoid OCPs Protein C & S Deficiency Background Autosomal dominant; first event occurs between 10-50 years of age Synthesized in liver and Vit K dependent, therefore low levels in hepatic dysfunction and warfarin use/vitamin K deficiency Protein C: low in settings of thrombosis, DIC, nephrotic syndrome, intra/post-op Protein S: low in infectious (HIV) and autoimmune processes (IBD) Protein S decreases during pregnancy (decreased free Protein S, normal total Protein S) Do not misdiagnose a pregnant patient with PS deficiency Evaluation Functional Protein C & S assays Management VTE treatment same as general population Avoid OCPs High risk patients may require protein C concentrate prior to surgery Increased risk of warfarin-induced skin necrosis Antithrombin deficiency Background Autosomal dominant, does not skip generations VTE in unusual sites (cerebral sinuses, renal veins) Present \\< 50 y/o, but rarely in first two decades Decreased in liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, protein losing enteropathy, burn, trauma, bypass surgery, metastatic tumors, premenopausal, OCP use, pregnancy Evaluation Functional antithrombin activity (AT-heparin cofactor assay) Then perform antigen quantity testing Management Can use Argatroban as does not require antithrombin function Warfarin preferred in VTE (titrate up based on expression of antithrombin deficiency) Coagulopathies \u2013 Jason Jones Step one: determine if platelet vs coagulation disorder Platelet Disorders: Skin/mucous membrane bleeding; Petechiae; Often mild bleeding following surgery and tends to immediately follow surgery Coagulation defect: Bleeding deep in soft tissues (muscles/joints); hemarthroses, hematomas; tendency to have delayed bleeding after surgery that can be severe Coagulopathies can be divided into Hereditary vs Acquired causes Hereditary Hemophilia A (Factor VIII Deficiency) and Hemophilia B (Factor IX Deficiency) Inherited in X-linked Recessive pattern Diagnosis: Isolated prolonged PTT with normalization upon mixing study Management: purified/recombinant Factor VIII or IX. Desmopressin for mild disease Consult benign hematology every time these patients are admitted von Willebrand Disease (vWD) Can be hereditary (common) or acquired Abnormal quantity or function of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) needed for platelet function Type 1 (most common): Quantitative defect. Low quantity, normal function of vWF Type 2: Qualitative defect. Normal quantity, abnormal function of vWF. Type 3 (rare): Complete absence of vWF, phenotypically similar to hemophilia A Order in Epic: vW Profile = vWF Ag, Factor VIII Activity, Ristocetin Cofactor Activity Management: Desmopressin (DDAVP) can be useful as prophylaxis or treatment; most patients are treated with factor concentrate replacements Acquired Coagulation Factor Inhibitors Associated with autoimmune disease (paraneoplastic vs. autoantibody) Seen in hemophilia due to frequent treatments with recombinant factors (alloantibody) Diagnosis: Elevated PTT that does not normalize with mixing study Management: Immunosuppression with steroids; cyclophosphamide \u00b1 rituximab Consult Hematology always (rare disorder with major bleeding complications) Vitamin K Deficiency Caused by malnutrition, liver disease, or iatrogenic with warfarin Diagnosis: elevated PT, if severe may have prolonged PTT as well Management: Replace vitamin K Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) - Eric Singhi Background Concurrent activation of the coagulation pathway and fibrinolytic pathway Consumption of platelets, fibrin, and coagulation factors fibrinolysis end organ damage and hemolysis Etiologies: Infection/Sepsis, Liver disease, Pancreatitis, Trauma Malignancies: mucin-secreting pancreatic/gastric adenocarcinoma, brain tumors, prostate cancer, all acute leukemias, acute promyelocytic leukemia Obstetric complications (i.e. preeclampsia/eclampsia, placental abruption) Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (i.e. ABO incompatible transfusion) Evaluation Exam: petechiae, bleeding (mucosal, IV site, surgical wound site, hematuria), ecchymoses, thrombosis (i.e. cold, pulseless extremities) CBC, PT/INR, aPTT, Fibrinogen, D-Dimer, Peripheral Blood Smear \u201cDIC labs\u201d = q6h fibrinogen, PT/INR, aPTT (space out when lower risk) Findings suggestive of DIC: thrombocytopenia, prolonged aPTT and PT/INR, hypofibrinogenemia, elevated D-dimer, fibrin degradation products, schistocytes Management Treat the underlying cause! Vitamin K for INR > 1.7 or bleeding Hypofibrinogenemia treatment: Cryoprecipitate 5-10 units if fibrinogen \\< 100 Thrombocytopenia treatment: plt transfusion as normally indicated DVT ppx if not bleeding and plt > 50 VTE: anticoagulation if plt > 50 and no massive bleeding Transfusion Medicine \u2013 R.

If bleeding, consider raising transfusion threshold of cryoprecipitate to fibrinogen \\<150 For elevated INR, consider FFP transfusion. Thresholds for doing this vary by attending Cirrhosis: General concept: PT/INR, aPTT are unreliable markers for bleeding. Fibrinogen \u2264100 \u2013 120 or thromboelastography are better surrogates for bleeding risk Transfuse fibrinogen \u2264100 \u2013 120 if the patient is actively bleeding or about to undergo a procedure or surgery other than paracentesis Transfuse FFP based on hepatology team preference (generally few indications for FFP) Transfusion Premedication & Reactions If you are concerned about a serious transfusion reaction, pause the transfusion and contact the blood bank asap Order the transfusion reaction blood testing in Epic. You will send a CBC, the bag of blood products, and the completed form to the blood bank for analysis Premedication: Only if history of severe reaction Diphenhydramine 25-50mg IV Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Meperidine 25-50 mg IV (optional for chills) Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV (optional, for severe reactions or reactions despite acetaminophen and diphenhydramine) Reaction Signs & Symptoms Etiology Clinical Action Allergic (mild) Pruritus, hives limited to small area Antibodies to transfused plasma proteins Pause transfusion. Administer antihistamines. Resume transfusion if improved; NO samples necessary. If no improvement in 30 min treat as moderate to severe.

molecular) \u201cremission\u201d Defined as absence of symptoms, normal CBC, and \\< 5% blasts in bone marrow (on day 28) Then waiting in hospital until neutrophil count > 500 (typically ~3 weeks) From there, bone marrow transplant (for high-risk disease) or \u201cconsolidation\u201d chemo for normal-risk or low-risk disease AML Induction Typical is \u201c7+3\u201d i.e. idrarubicin on days 1-3 and cytarabine on days 1-7 If therapy-related AML, MDS-related AML, or AML with cytogenetics similar to MDS, use \u201cVyxeos\u201d which is liposomal daunorubicin and cytarabine on days 1, 3, and 5 If low-risk dz (t(8;21) or inv(16)), use cytarabine on days 1-7, and 3 days of low-dose daunorubicin + gemtuzumab-ozogamicin There are other induction regimens that can be used depending on specific cytogenetics and patient frailty, which is beyond the scope of the handbook Consolidation Typically \u201cHiDAC\u201d(high-dose Ara-C i.e. cytarabine) Generally too toxic for pts with age > 60, so a

pad biopsy with Congo red staining typically sufficient vs direct biopsy of amyloid-involved tissue Additional Tips for Lab Interpretation SPEP/UPEP Free light chains (FLC) Urinalysis Initial screening test to look and quantify M-protein Serum immunofixation determines clonality (e.g. mono or polyclonal) Monoclonal spike >1.5 is indicative of underlying dyscrasia Polyclonal spike suggests infectious, inflammatory, or reactive etiology Ratio of kappa/lambda >3 highly suggestive of plasma cell dyscrasia or amyloidosis Ratio 1.65 to 3 can be due to infectious process or renal insufficiency Helpful in pts that only produce Bence-Jones protein (FLC w/o heavy chain) which isn't seen on SPEP Detects albumin, not light chains In myeloma cast nephropathy, dipstick will be

bone marrow cell lineages (granulocytes, erythrocytes, or megakaryocytes) MPNs differ from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); cells in MPNs are normally developed (i.e. not dysplastic) Four \u201cclassic\u201d MPNs: polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) Polycythemia Vera (PV) Background Polycythemia is a general term: Men = Hb/Hct > 16.5/49%; Women = Hb/Hct > 16/48% Relative polycythemia = Concentrated H/H due to decreased plasma volume Diuretic use, vomiting, diarrhea; H/H should normalize with fluid resuscitation Absolute polycythemia = Increased RBC mass Primary polycythemia: 2/2 Inherited/acquired mutation in RBC progenitor Secondary polycythemia: Increase in RBC mass due to elevated serum EPO Hypoxia/cardiopulmonary associated (chronic pulmonary disease, R-to-L cardiac shunts, sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, chronic carbon monoxide poisoning, including heavy smoking) Kidney

There needs to be a recent serum HCT for comparison. Amylase: If concerned for pancreatic ascites Glucose, LDH if concern about secondary peritonitis (see below) Management 2000mg sodium restriction per day for all ascites (Grade 1-3) Diuretics (spironolactone and typically furosemide) Start at 100mg of spironolactone with up titration to 400mg Furosemide is added if insufficient diuresis or if limited by hyperkalemia. Use more loop diuretics in patients with CKD. If Urine Na:K ratio \\<1, indicates insufficient natriuresis. Can \u2191 doses to a max of 400:160 If poor response can change to torsemide 10mg and \u2191 to 40mg max (per single dose) Fluid restriction usually not necessary unless serum sodium \\<125 mmol/L Large volume paracentesis should be performed for tense ascites or refractory ascites (grade 3), regardless of serum Cr. Pts should be tapped dry with each paracentesis Give 6-8g of albumin per liter of ascites removed, even if \\< 5L Target weight loss of 0.5 kg/day when diuresing to avoid renal injury Discontinue NSAIDs and ACEI/ARB Refractory Ascites: Two distinctions: Diuretic-resistant: lack of response to diuretics (max spironolactone 400mg/lasix 160mg), Na restriction and rapid recurrence following paracentesis Diuretic-intractable: unable to tolerate diuretic therapy 2/2 adverse drug effects (unexplained HE, AKI, K abnormalities, hypoNa, intractable muscle cramps) Management aside from liver transplant: Discontinue diuretics once refractory ascites has been established Consider oral midodrine; can be especially helpful if pt is also hypotensive Serial paracenteses, generally arranged OP with IR Consider TIPS (trans jugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt; has survival benefit). Following TIPS, cessation or decrease in ascites should occur in 4-6 weeks Consider discontinuing beta blockers in patients with refractory ascites if sBP \\<90, SCr >1.5, or Na \\<130 Hepatic Hydrothorax Background Transudative effusion, typically unilateral (75% right sided); reflects ascitic fluid that passes through defects in the diaphragm. 10% can develop without clinical ascites. Present in 4-12% of cirrhotics and portends a poor prognosis (75% mortality within 90 days) Evaluation Often suspected clinically, though must exclude pleural/cardiopulmonary process Thoracentesis will demonstrate a transudative effusion and should be evaluated with standard pleural fluid lab tests: cell count, protein, albumin, LDH, culture Other considerations: triglycerides, amylase, hematocrit, cytology Rule out SBE which is diagnosed the same as SBP (PMN>250) Management Similar management of ascites as noted above AVOID chest-tube placement. Associated with increased morbidity and mortality due to extensive loss of fluid, electrolytes and protein as well as increased infection risk PleurX catheters can be considered for palliation (e.g., hospice patients) Refractory Hydrothorax is defined similarly and managed similarly with serial thoracentesis or TIPS. For those who are not candidates, consider: Chemical pleurodesis (not commonly performed at VUMC due to complications) Thoracoscopic mesh repair in pts with clear diaphragmatic deficits (not common practice at VUMC ) Management of spontaneous bacterial empyema is the same as in SBP (see below) Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) \u2013 Patricia Checinski Background Infection of ascitic fluid without evidence of a surgical intra-abdominal source Presentation: fever, abdominal pain, encephalopathy, renal failure, acidosis, and/or leukocytosis Evaluation Any pt with cirrhosis and ascites who is admitted should have diagnostic paracentesis to rule out SBP. Delaying paracentesis > 12 hours is associated with a 2.7-fold increase in mortality. Obtain cell count with diff. Calculate the PMNs: total nucleated cells x % neutrophils. PMNs > 250 cells is diagnostic of SBP. If there are greater than 100k RBCs, you should correct for them: for every 250 RBCs, subtract 1 PMN A positive ascitic bacterial culture with PMN \\<250 is called bacterascites and asymptomatic patients should NOT receive antibiotics. You will also frequently see culture-negative SBP (neutrocytic ascites) which SHOULD be treated (see below). Management Immediately start empiric antibiotics Guidelines recommend cefotaxime IV 2gm q8 hours x 5 days, but we commonly use ceftriaxone IV 2g q24h for 5-7 days at VUMC and Nashville VA. Most common culprits (E. coli, Klebsiella, streptococcal species, staphylococcal species) If SBP developed with recent hospital admission (90 days), recent exposure to BSA, diagnosed >48 hours of admission, or with sepsis, consider zosyn or meropenem to cover MDROs IV albumin 1.5 g/kg on day 1 and 1g/kg on day 3 Discontinue beta-blockers once SBP develops and do not restart until SBP is completely treated, Na >130, and no AKI PPI\u2019s \u2191 risk for SBP in pts with cirrhosis, and should be reviewed for appropriateness Repeat diagnostic paracentesis two days after antibiotics initiated If \\<25% decrease in PMNs, antibiotics should be broadened. Consider secondary bacterial peritonitis Prophylaxis GI bleed: ceftriaxone 1g daily ciprofloxacin 500mg BID (preferred) or Bactrim one DS tablet BID x 5-7 days Outpatient lifelong ppx: Indicated for: Prior SBP Ascitic protein \\<1.5 AND Child Pugh >9 and bilirubin >3 OR Renal dysfunction (Cr >1.2, Na \\<130, or BUN >25) Preferred: Bactrim DS tab daily or ciprofloxacin 500mg daily Alternatives: cefdinir 300mg daily, Augmentin 875/125 daily If suspicion is high for secondary bacterial peritonitis: Examine serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). SBP develops in pts with portal hypertension, defined by SAAG > 1.1 g/dL. SBP is unlikely if SAAG is \\< 1.1 g/dL. While not particularly sensitive, an ascitic leukocyte count of 5-10k should prompt consideration of secondary peritonitis Amylase from fluid can also be helpful to point towards pancreatic ascites, while bilirubin can indicate gallbladder perforation. Peritoneal fluid CEA and alkaline phosphatase can additionally help identify hollow viscus injury. Evaluate with cross-sectional imaging and surgical consultation as appropriate Runyon\u2019s Criteria to distinguish, requires \u2154 criteria below (protein, glucose, LDH) Spontaneous Secondary Protein (g/dL) \\< 1 > 1 Glucose (mg/dL) \u226550 \\< 50 LDH (U) Elevated, but \\< 225 > 225 Organisms 0-1 Polymicrobial Gastroesophageal Varices and Hemorrhage \u2013 Patricia Checinski Background Varices form due to portosystemic collaterals in the setting of portal HTN The risk of mortality with each episode of esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH) is 15-25% Recurrence occurs in 60% of patients within 1-2 years of the index event Variceal Screening Not all pts with cirrhosis require screening. Can be omitted without clinically significant portal hypertension (e.g. low liver stiffness (on elastography) and platelets >150) or if pt already on non-selective beta blocker (NSBB) with HR 55-60 Compensated cirrhosis without varices: EGD q3yr, unless active liver injury (obesity, EtOH use, ongoing viral infxn), then q2yr Compensated cirrhosis with small varices: EGD q2yr unless active liver injury, then q1yr Decompensated cirrhosis with no or small nonbleeding varices: EGD q1yr, and at initial time of decompensation Management (Non-Bleeding Varices) Primary ppx with either NSBB (preferred) or endoscopic band ligation (EBL) Nadolol (given nightly as portal pressures are highest at night) or propranolol (BID) Carvedilol has greater portal pressures and may be preferred if tolerated (goal 6.25mg BID) For 2 \u00ba ppx, initiate ~72hr after acute bleed has resolved and octreotide discontinued Discontinue if: hypotension (sBP \\<90), AKI, SBP or hyponatremia with refractory ascites Secondary ppx with both NSBB and EBL. NSBB are associated with reduced mortality, while EBL is not Management (Bleeding Varices) Place two large-bore IVs (18G or larger), resuscitate with blood products and albumin. Activate massive transfusion protocol if needed. Consider intubation if need for emergent EGD, change in mental status, ongoing hematemesis, concern of ability to protect airway Start octreotide 50 mcg IV bolus followed by continuous infusion of 50 mcg/h, to be continued for at least 2 days should EVH be confirmed on endoscopy Ceftriaxone 1g IV q24h for SBP prophylaxis (reduced mortality), then transition to PO ciprofloxacin for total 7-day course Consult GI for upper endoscopy. Endoscopic therapies performed include variceal band ligation and sclerotherapy. Consider balloon tamponade with Blakemore as temporizing measure before definitive management. Patient must be intubated before placement, and preferably GI should be made aware prior to placement. No role for the correction of INR, even in the presence of bleeding as excessive blood products and FFP can increase portal pressures and cause worsening bleeding Vitamin K can be given w/ \u2191 INR, though is unlikely to help in the acute setting Check TEG and fibrinogen and transfuse based on results AASLD does not recommend specific platelet targets during variceal hemorrhage Administer blood products in balanced ratio to avoid transfusion related coagulopathy (VUMC MTP is 6:4:1 of RBC:FFP:PLT) Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) Evaluation Asterixis: inability to maintain stable posture; many ways to assess Check for clonus Have pt \u201chold out hands like you are stopping traffic\u201d (if following commands) Shine light in pupil (look up video of hippus) Grade Behavior Change I Mild confusion, changes in behavior, increased sleep, no asterixis, cannot be confirmed without neuropsych testing II Moderate confusion, lethargic, AAOx2, +asterixis III Marked confusion, arousable but falls asleep, incoherent speech, AAOx1, +asterixis IV Coma Identify precipitants Infection (rule out SBP in addition to CXR, BCx, UA/Cx), Medication non-adherence (lactulose) GI bleed (perform rectal exam and observe Hgb trend) Over-diuresis resulting in dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities (especially hypoK) Sedatives/benzo/opiate administration (UDS) Ammonia (NH3) levels do not play a role in the acute management of HE Arterial NH3 is used in acute liver failure for prognostication (not for management) Management Always determine precipitant and treat underlying condition Lactulose 30mL TID initially Titrate dose to at least 4 BMs daily, avoid excessive stool output which may exacerbate HE due to dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities Consider lactulose enemas vs DHT placement if pt unable to tolerate PO DHT are not contraindicated in patients with esophageal varices, but should be avoided in patients with recent hemorrhage or banding Add Rifaximin after the second episode of HE, or if failure to respond to lactulose Frequently requires prior authorization for outpatient approval and is expensive Lactulose is generally continued indefinitely after first episode of HE, though discontinuation can be considered if predisposing factors (recurrent infection, EVH, EtOH use) have resolved AKI & Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS) \u2013 Garren Montgomery Background Portal HTN causes shear stress on portal vessels endothelium release of vasodilators splanchnic vasodilation and reduced effective blood volume (decreased MAP) RAAS activation sodium and water retention and severe renal vasoconstriction Bacterial translocation (as seen in SBP) increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines splanchnic vasodilation Definitions: HRS-AKI (formerly type I HRS): Rise in Cr \u22650.3 within 48h, rise in Cr \u226550% within 7 days, OR UOP \\<0.5 mL/kg/hr for 6 hours HRS-NAKI (\u201cnon-AKI\u201d) (formerly type II HRS): HRS-AKD: eGFR\\<60 for \\<3 months in absence of other structural causes OR % rise in Cr \u226450% using last available Cr over last 3 months as baseline HRS-CKD: eGFR\\<60 for \u22653 months in absence of other structural causes Diagnostic Criteria Diagnosis of AKI (see above) without other cause (see below) No response or inadequate response at 48 hrs after volume expansion with albumin and withdrawal of diuretics Absence of proteinuria (\\<500 mg/d), absence of hematuria (\\<50 RBCs per HPF), normal renal ultrasound (exclude if patient has known CKD) Suggestion of renal vasoconstriction with FeNa \\<0.2, FeUrea \\<20 (most sensitive diagnostic measure). UNa \\<20 is suggestive but not diagnostic given baseline sodium avidity in cirrhosis and inability to calculate FeNa Cut off for ATN in cirrhosis is a FeNa >0.5, rather than 1 in the general population Evaluation Step 1: Exclude other obvious causes of renal injury such as hypovolemia or ATN Common precipitants of AKI: infection, overdiuresis, GI bleeding, recent LVP without subsequent volume expansion, nephrotoxic drugs/NSAIDs Workup: BMP, UA with microscopy, urine electrolytes (FeNa, FeUrea), urine protein/Cr ratio, renal ultrasound (to assess for chronicity), diagnostic para to rule out SBP Step 2: Diuretic cessation/albumin challenge STOP all diuretics, beta blockers, NSAIDs, ACE/ARBs, anti-hypertensives, vasodilators, nephrotoxins START volume expansion with albumin 1g/kg/day (up to a max of 100 g/day) x2 days Step 3: Diagnosis of HRS If no other clear cause of AKI is identified and SCr has not improved after 48 hours of diuretic cessation and volume expansion, proceed promptly to vasopressor treatment Management Pharmacologic therapies (in order of preference): Terlipressin + albumin. Most effective combo based on clinical trials, NOW AVAILABLE (ongoing clinical trial at VUMC) Norepinephrine + albumin (25-50 g/day) Most likely to be used at VUMC, requires central access (PICC vs triple lumen) but can be administered on stepdown unit Guidelines recommend NE to be dosed at 0.5-3 mg/hr. Would ask fellow, attending or pharmacist for baseline. VUMC protocol for ICU and stepdown: Start NE gtt at 3mcg/min. If UOP is \\<200 or MAP \\<10mm Hg from baseline, increase by 3 mcg/min every 4 hours Continue to hold diuretics. LVP is still generally considered safe even in HRS if indicated by tense ascites (account for albumin repletion from LVP and HRS protocol). This can be attending specific and would confirm prior to performing Therapy is generally continued until HRS is reversed or the hepatology attending deems it refractory to medical treatment Patients with HRS-NAKI (formerly type II HRS) may respond to the above therapies, but recurrence of renal dysfunction after withdrawal of vasoconstrictors is the norm and thus current guidelines do not recommend them for this scenario RRT: Dialysis can be considered for those who fail to respond to pharmacologic therapy, particularly ONLY as a bridge to liver transplant. Decision to initiate should be individualized Liver transplant: The best and most definitive treatment regardless of response to pharmacologic therapy Simultaneous liver-kidney transplant: HRS often resolves with LT alone. Indications for kidney transplant are usually for patients with severe chronic renal dysfunction or on RRT. Must consult transplant nephrology. Criteria for SLKT: eGFR \\<60 for >30 days AND latest eGFR \\<30 eGFR \\<25 for >6 consecutive weeks with a documented eGFR q7 days Metabolic syndromes and polycystic disease Can qualify for safety net kidney transplant after liver transplant if eGFR \\<20 2-12 months post-operatively (would be at higher priority than the rest of the kidney transplant list) Hyponatremia in Cirrhosis \u2013 John Laurenzano Background Most commonly is hypervolemic hyponatremia, driven by release of ADH from decreased effective arterial blood volume (EABV) in the setting of portal hypertension Hyponatremia in cirrhosis is a marker of advanced disease and is associated with higher rates of SBP, HE, HRS, and mortality. Evaluation Standard evaluation of hyponatremia, including Uosm, Sosm, UNa to rule out competing processes (e.g. beer potomania) Management Discontinue anti-hypertensives (including beta blockers) in patients with ascites and hyponatremia. Hold diuretics when Na \\<125 Fluid restriction is recommended only in patients with Na \\<125. Restriction is generally effective at 1-1.5L and must be less than daily urine output to increase free water excretion Replete potassium to 4.0, as potassium is as osmotically active and results in shifts in extra and intracellular fluids which lead to a net increase in serum sodium. 25% albumin infusion (1g/kg split into BID dosing), has been shown to increase serum sodium and have higher rates of hyponatremia resolution at 30 days Other treatment considerations include vasopressors, vaptans, urea tabs Salt tabs should not be used to raise serum Na due to worsening hypervolemia Nephrology should be consulted if not improved after 48 hours Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) \u2013 Pakinam Mekki Background A Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt or TIPS procedure is done by interventional radiology to manage sequelae of portal hypertension (specifically variceal bleeding and ascites) A low-resistance shunt is created between an intrahepatic branch of the portal vein and the hepatic vein, allowing blood to bypass the high-resistance vessels within the fibrotic liver Evaluation Indications for TIPS Variceal hemorrhage (esophageal, gastric, etc.) Early \u201cpreemptive\u201d TIPS is an urgent TIPS placement within 72 hrs (preferably within 24 hours) of initial endoscopic hemostasis in pts at high risk for rebleeding (Child-Pugh Class B with active bleeding upon insertion of endoscope or Child-Pugh Class C with recent bleeding \u201cRescue\u201d TIPS is placed in pts with active, uncontrolled variceal bleeding or if bleeding recurs despite maximal endoscopic and pharmacologic therapy Refractory ascites (prolongs survival) Other: portal hypertensive gastropathy, PVT recanalization, Budd-Chiari syndrome, hepatic hydrothorax Contraindications to TIPS Absolute contraindications Primary prevention of variceal bleeding, congestive heart failure, severe tricuspid regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension, multiple hepatic cysts or masses, Sepsis, unrelieved biliary obstruction Relative contraindications Hepatic encephalopathy, hepatic tumors (especially if centrally located), thrombocytopenia, moderate pulmonary hypertension Pre-procedure preparation Labs: CBC, CMP, INR Liver imaging to assess portal system patency and exclude liver masses Ideally triple phase CT with contrast In pts with renal impairment or active variceal bleeding, RUQ U/S with doppler is acceptable TTE to evaluate for evidence of congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or valvular disease. Antibiotic ppx with ceftriaxone 1g IV once at the time of TIPS insertion as enteric bacteria within the static portal system can enter systemic circulation Patients with HE should receive rifaximin prophylaxis starting 2 weeks before procedure Management Post-TIPS Immediately following TIPS, pts are observed in the hospital overnight for complications Monitor CBC and vitals closely. If hemodynamically unstable, STAT CBC and low threshold to obtain CTA A/P to evaluate for a bleeding source TIPS causes a substantial increase in venous return to the heart, which can unmask cardiac dysfunction that was previously compensated for Obtain RUQ U/S with Doppler to assess shunt patency 1 month of TIPS placement, or if ascites and/or variceal hemorrhage reoccur If patient with a TIPS develops refractory HE, can consider TIPS revision to lessen HE symptoms Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) \u2013 Lee Richardson, Julie Cui Background Pts with HCV cirrhosis are at greatest risk (incidence 2-4% per year) In chronic HBV and NASH, pts can develop HCC without having cirrhosis Evaluation Regular screening in pts with cirrhosis (or chronic HBV without cirrhosis) for HCC RUQ U/S q6mo (with or without AFP) Routine screening with CT or MRI is not recommended Options If U/S not satisfactory: CT A/P w/contrast, in comments specify triple phase for HCC screening MRI, specify Gadovist (preferred contrast agent) Contrast-enhanced ultrasound AFP trend is more useful than one value in time, though AFP >20 should prompt multiphase CT or MRI for further evaluation Diagnosis can be made either by imaging (most common) or biopsy (rare) Triple phase CT demonstrates strong early uptake in arterial phase, with subsequent wash-out in portal-venous phase If diagnosis remains unclear: can surveillance imaging or biopsy LI-RADS system notes risk of malignancy based on imaging characteristics LI-RADS What does it mean? What do we do? LR-1 to LR-2 Definitely/probably benign Routine surveillance, consider diagnostic imaging within 6 mos LR-3 to LR-4 Indeterminate/probably HCC Repeat or alternative diagnostic imaging in 3-6 mos. Consider Bx for LI-RADS 4 LR-5 Definitely HCC Plan treatment as noted below LR-M Cancer, but may not be HCC Management Lesions that meet Milan criteria can qualify for MELD exception points and are considered transplant candidates This accounts for pts with minimal synthetic dysfunction (and therefore low MELD) Milan criteria: Single tumor with diameter >2cm but \\<5 cm, no more than 3 tumors, each \\<3 cm No signs of extra-hepatic involvement or vascular invasion Liver transplant is definitive treatment, although resection can also be curative (favored in pts with early cirrhosis i.e. Child Pugh A) Locoregional therapies: Pts with unresectable disease, or who are not surgical candidates Therapy Details Radiofrequency ablation If in a favorable location and size, IR can percutaneously ablate with a large needle that emits microwave frequencies Trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) Chemotherapeutic agents injected into the tumor to occlude the feeding blood supply to the area. Trans-arterial radioembolization (TARE) Like TACE, though radioactive compound (i.e. Y-90) used to occlude the feeding blood supply. Stereotactic body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) Radiation therapy: can be used as an alternative to ablation or trans-arterial therapy Systemic Chemotherapy For metastatic disease Coagulopathy in Cirrhosis \u2013 Garren Montgomery, John Laurenzano Background The liver is responsible for production of both pro- (factor II, V, VII, IV, X, and XI) and anti-coagulants (protein C, S) in hemostasis. Factor VIII is the only one not made by the liver. Thrombocytopenia is caused by splenic sequestration from portal HTN, failure to produce thrombopoietin (TPO), and bone marrow failure Evaluation INR/PT, and PTT are poorly reflective of bleeding risk TEG screens and other measures of comprehensive coagulation in cirrhotics Management Even in bleeding, there is no need to intervene on an INR or platelet value Pre-procedural FFP is not recommended, even in the presence of bleeding, but is frequently requested by different proceduralists Low risk procedures (i.e., paracentesis) do not require pre-procedural blood products In bleeding pts, the following are recommended per AASLD and AGA guidelines IV Vitamin K 10mg x 3 days FFP: Not recommended, unless as part of a balanced transfusion effort to avoid transfusion related coagulopathy, or if a TEG screen suggests potential benefit Cryoprecipitate: if fibrinogen \\< 120 Platelets: No specific targets regardless of bleeding. Pre-procedurally, recommend >50 Appropriate DVT ppx should be given with few exceptions (plts \\<50k, active hemorrhage) For TEG transfusion recommendations are as follows: 10 mg/kg FFP if R-time >10 minutes 1u Plts if maximum amplitude \\<55 mm 5u cryo if alpha angle \\<45 Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT) \u2013 John Laurenzano Background Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT) can worsen decompensation (i.e. variceal hemorrhage), however, worsening portal HTN more sluggish flow increased risk PVT Presentation Often identified asymptomatically on U/S, but can be identified by new or worsening decompensation of portal HTN Variceal hemorrhage is the most common decompensating event associated with PVT Intestinal ischemia (abdominal pain, hematochezia) from PVT is exceedingly rare but associated with significant morbidity and mortality Evaluation RUQ U/S with doppler Once identified, should be further assessed with triple phase CT or MRI with Gadovist contrast to exclude HCC with tumor thrombus Pts with newly identified PVT should undergo EGD to evaluate for high-risk varices, both for diagnostic and therapeutic considerations PVT in pts without cirrhosis should prompt evaluation for hypercoagulable disorders Management Start anticoagulation if acute thrombus occludes >50% of main portal vein, \\<50% but extends into SMV, thrombus is symptomatic, or patient is a transplant candidate (irrespective of size). Requires discussion with attending/transplant team. Anticoagulation options: warfarin, LMWH, or DOAC DOAC\u2019s are safe in Childs Class A, can be used with caution in Childs B, and are contraindicated in Childs C Pts with chronic occlusive PVT (>6 mos) or with cavernous transformation with collaterals do not generally benefit from anticoagulation Pts with high-risk varices should undergo endoscopic management or be on NSBB for prophylaxis for variceal hemorrhage, as noted above TIPS with portal vein recanalization has recently emerged as a therapeutic modality for PVT Pts should undergo follow up intermittently with ultrasound to assess for recanalization. AC may be stopped if there is failure to recanalize. If pts are not candidates for AC, they'll simply be treated for complications of portal HTN Alcoholic Hepatitis \u2013 Alex Wiles, Julie Cui Background Acute onset of rapidly progressive jaundice in pt with heavy EtOH intake (>40g in females or >60g in males EtOH/day for >6 mos, or within \\<60 days of abstinence) May present after they have quit drinking due to immunosuppressive effects of alcohol Evaluation AST >60, AST/ALT >1.5, both values \\<400 IU/L; TBili >3.0 mg/dL, documentation of heavy EtOH use until 8 weeks prior to presentation Prognostication with Maddrey\u2019s Discriminant Function: 4.6 * (PTpt \u2013 PTctrl) + Tbili Maddrey > 32 = poor 30d prognosis & may benefit from steroids (see below) RUQ U/S to rule out obstructive cause of jaundice Biopsy is not typically required but will show neutrophilic lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, steatosis, and pericellular fibrosis. Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) level is a biomarker of ethanol consumption over ~ 4wks; >20 ng/mL can indicate chronic moderate/heavy alcohol intake A single episode consumption can result in detectable Peth for up to 12 days. Can be elevated for months with regular heavy alcohol intake EtOH levels may be negative unless acutely intoxicated Management Supportive Care is essential! Consult nutrition, start high protein, high calorie diet, high dose Thiamine x 3d, Folate, MVI Full infection workup (CXR, UA, BCx, paracentesis) regardless of symptoms Steroids: STOP-AH Trial (NEJM 2015) showed improved mortality at 28 days but not at 90 days in patients with Maddrey > 32 who received steroids; the decision to treat is very nuanced and should be discussed with hepatology attending. Prednisolone 40mg daily for pts who meet above criteria Contraindications to steroids include: presence of infection (must rule out first including TB, uncontrolled GI bleeding, AKI w/ Cr >2.5 mg/dL) The Lille score can be used to guide continuation of steroids after 7 d of therapy NAC can be considered as adjunctive therapy to steroids and may decrease 30-day mortality, though has not demonstrated longer mortality benefit at 3 or 6 months Monitor on CIWA Psychiatry consultation as appropriate, consideration of medical therapy (see \u201cSubstance Use Disorders\u201d section in psychiatry) NASH and NAFLD \u2013 John Laurenzano Background Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): presence of hepatic steatosis in the absence of secondary causes (e.g, EtOH) Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): evidence of active inflammation in conjunction with steatosis (elevated liver enzymes or evidence on bx) Strong association with metabolic syndrome, T2DM, HTN, obesity, prior cholecystectomy Generally asymptomatic Considered to be a common cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis Evaluation NASH manifests with elevated liver enzymes, typically 2-5x the ULN, in a roughly 1:1 ratio (as opposed to alcoholic steatohepatitis), though ALT may be higher than AST NAFLD is asymptomatic and frequently found incidentally via imaging Exclusion of alternative causes and comorbid liver conditions: HCV, HBV, EtOH Note: Ferritin is frequently elevated, though not to the extent of hemochromatosis. Low level auto-antibodies are also frequently present Can be diagnosed based on imaging alone (and frequently is) Ultrasound is used most frequently, though MRI and CT also are acceptable; use risk scores to determine the risk of advanced fibrosis and identify those who would benefit from biopsy Fibrosis-4 (FIB 4) score NAFLD fibrosis score More accurate, non-invasive fibrosis assessments can be done using elastography which can be vibration based (fibroscan), ultrasound based (sheer-wave), or MR-based Available at VUMC and can be ordered by anyone. Insurance will not cover MRE if BMI \\<35 Management Aggressive risk factor modification and management of comorbidities (HLD, HTN, T2DM) Weight loss: Mediterranean diet>low fat diet (dose dependent improvement) No specific medications are FDA approved currently Pioglitazone has shown benefit in pts with T2DM and NASH Vitamin E has shown benefit in pts without T2DM and proven NASH Ongoing studies for SGLT-2i and GLP-1ra; some promise indicated for the latter While bariatric surgery is not a specific indication for NASH/NAFLD, increasing evidence demonstrates resolution of NASH and fibrosis in pts with clinically significant weight loss Referral to the surgical weight loss clinic should be considered in any patient who meets obesity guidelines for bariatric surgery (BMI >40, or >35 with metabolic comorbidities) Additional Information Statins: should be used for HLD in pts with NASH, NAFLD and NASH cirrhosis Statin use in decompensated NASH cirrhosis is controversial, and they are less likely to derive benefit given overall poor prognosis. There is an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis in pts with acute on chronic liver failure and are considered contraindicated Metformin is safe and may have a survival benefit in patients with diabetes and cirrhosis.

Medical errors (especially medication errors) following discharge are exceedingly common and can lead to adverse events At VUMC we are fortunate to have the Discharge Care Center Multidisciplinary team including nurses, social workers, care coordinators, and pharmacists Phone number is included on discharge paperwork and patients can contact them 24/7. The DCC also reaches out to patients through an automated system How residents can promote safe discharges: Communicate with patient\u2019s outpatient team (i.e. PCP) Typically achieved through the discharge summary Include a list of specific, actionable follow-up tasks and assign a responsible party. Place in easy-to-view spot at the top of the summary Ex: Instead of writing \u201cfollow-up BMP after initiation of furosemide,\u201d write \u201cPCP to check BMP in 2 weeks after initiation of furosemide\u201d Include any pending studies and appointments from hospital admission All relevant parties should receive a copy of the discharge summary (see appendices section for mechanics of discharge process) It is useful to send patient with a printed copy of the discharge summary if they will follow-up outside VUMC For high-risk discharges (patients with poor health literacy, hx of being lost to follow-up, patients following up outside VUMC) consider calling PCP\u2019s office to set follow-up Complete an accurate and thorough medication reconciliation An accurate discharge medication list depends on having a complete admission medication reconciliation (utilize pharmacy consult!) Three steps to medication reconciliation: Verification: Performing a Best Possible Medication History Clarification: Checking that medications and doses are appropriate Reconciliation: Record all medication changes Seek to use at least two sources of information Keep a list of any held or changed medications in your hospital course. Medication changes can be lost when not communicated during team transitions Review medication changes on rounds and with pharmacist on day of discharge (bonus points for day prior to discharge) Highlight any significant medication changes on discharge summary Can include as follow-up tasks if pertinent (ex: PCP to follow-up BP in 2 weeks.

This is usually completed by the nutrition team Recognize who would benefit from nutrition consult to assist with risk determination Patients with >5% weight loss in past 1-3 months or decreased oral intake coupled with increased metabolic demands due to medical illness or surgery Patients with low nutritional risk may not need enteral feeding if it is anticipated they will resume intake in 5-7 days Critically ill patients: goal is early initiation of tube feeding (within 48 hours) Contraindications to enteral nutrition Bowel obstruction or severe ileus Ischemic bowel Acute peritonitis Major gastrointestinal bleeding Intractable vomiting Significant hemodynamic instability Patients who are not adequately volume resuscitated and have significant hemodynamic instability (i.e., have high pressor requirements) are thought to be at increased risk for bowel ischemia Pressors in general are not a contraindication to tube feeds. Ok to start once pressors are down-trending or at a stable level Initiating tube feeds Enteral access Nasogastric or orogastric feeding tube in acute setting. See procedures section for tips on placement For most patients, enteral feeding is safe with gastric tube placement Consider post-pyloric placement for patients with high aspiration risk, impaired gastric motility, or patients who have demonstrated intolerance with gastric feeding Consider percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement if anticipate enteral nutrition >4 weeks Choice of formula and rate Place nutrition consult. RD will calculation caloric and protein needs to determine goal rate and formulation OK to start tube feeds prior to recommendations and adjust later, especially if recommendations will be delayed. It only takes a simple calculation to make a reasonable tube feeding plan Use weight-based dosing for calorie requirements Use 25-30 cal/kg (use ideal body weight for most patients, use actual weight for underweight patient) to estimate daily needs Most common formula used at VUMC is Nutren 1.5 (1.5 cal/ml) or Novasource renal if significant renal impairment (2 cal/ml) Patients may need additional free water (most tube feed formulas are comprised of 80-85% water but varies with type). Typically dose as bolus of free water every 4-6 hours. May empirically try 250cc free water every 4 hours and monitor Na trends. May need more if already with a large fluid deficit (ex: hypernatremia) or if high volume losses May use clinical calculators as below Calculate hourly rate based on daily calorie need and formula calorie density Ex: Patient with IBW of 70Kg will need estimated 1,750 calories per day (70 x 25 cal/kg) If using Nutren 1.5, this will equal 1,167 ml per day (1,750 divided by 1.5 calories per ml). This would equal a goal rate of about 50ml per hour (rounded up) of Nutren 1.5 Resources for quick calculations: Search for \u201ctube feed cheat sheet\u201d on google and will find reference tables on EMCrit.org that gives you rate per hour for different weights and formula types Clincalc.com also has a useful enteral nutrition calculator Start initially at a low rate (such as 10 mL/hr) to assess tolerability and advance to goal Advance quickly if no concern for refeeding syndrome (ex: increase by 10cc/hr q6h) If risk for refeeding syndrome or other issues with tolerability, typically advance more slowly over several days Potential Complications Aspiration Recommendation to keep head of bed elevated at 30 to 45 degrees (low quality, mixed evidence). Consider risks of this positioning (ex: formation of pressure ulcers) Consider post-pyloric placement if issues with aspiration (low quality, mixed evidence) Diarrhea or constipation Consider wheat dextrin fiber supplement (low quality evidence) but discontinue if not associated with clinical improvement. Avoid less soluble fibers such as psyllium due to risk of clogging tube. Avoid in patients with reduced GI motility due to rare risk of bezoar formation Hyperglycemia See endocrine section for management Refeeding syndrome Monitor q8 hour Mg, phos, K in high-risk patients (underweight, recent weight loss, prolonged poor intake) and advance to goal slowly Guidelines for Pregnant Patients \u2013 Ahmad Dbouk and Samuel Lazaroff Acute Cystitis Significantly increased prevalence in pregnancy Symptoms: dysuria (urgency/frequency common in pregnancy) Diagnosis: evidence of pyuria and >103 cfu/ml (note, if neg would test for g/c) Treatment: Empiric with cephalexin, cefpodoxime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, fosfomycin.

Brain biopsy may be indicated if diagnostic uncertainty. Management: Pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin is the preferred regimen, discuss dosing with pharmacy. Alternative regimens: clindamycin, Bactrim, atovaquone, and/or azithromycin. - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) Presentation: chronic (weeks to months), progressive neurologic dysfunction, particularly incoordination and other motor dysfunction, aphasia, sometimes cognitive impairment and personality changes Evaluation: MRI brain w/patchy areas of demyelination in the subcortical white matter; location is variable, but p arietal, occipital, and cerebellar involvement are common. JC virus PCR from CSF. Brain biopsy (uncommonly done) Management: Initiation of ART may slow/stop progression. Fatal if HIV goes untreated. - HIV-related encephalopathy Presentation: Similar to other progressive dementias, with short term memory loss followed by worsening global cognitive dysfunction, motor deficits, sometimes seizures in late stages Evaluation: MRI w/diffuse cerebral atrophy and/or demyelinating lesions similar to PML. CSF w/elevated protein \u00b1 lymphocytic pleocytosis, with no alternative cause. Send HIV RNA from the CSF, usually + in HIV encephalopathy - Cryptococcal meningitis Presentation: Subacute to chronically worsening HA and fevers; meningismus and photophobia may be present but are often absent; rarely, focal neurologic deficits Evaluation: LP to check opening pressure and can send serum and CSF Cryptococcus Ag. Brain imaging may be non-diagnostic Treatment: Induction therapy with amphotericin and flucytosine x14 days (at least), with repeat LP close to end of induction to confirm CSF inflammation is improving and fungal culture is negative. Maintenance therapy consists of high dose fluconazole for at least 8 weeks. Pts may require serial LP to manage ICP Delay ART for several weeks after start of treatment to avoid risk of IRIS. - CMV retinitis (with vision loss) Presentation: Blurry vision, focal blind spots, visual field deficits, or scotomas and floaters. Typically begins unilateral, though often progresses to bilateral involvement. Evaluation: Always consult ophtho if you suspect it! Hemorrhagic retinitis, \u201ctomato soup and milk\u201d appearance on dilated exam. May cause complete retinal detachment. Check CMV pcr serum (or vitreous) Management: PO valgancyclovir (+intravitreous ganciclovir or foscarnet in severe disease). If not on ART, must delay ART for at least 2 weeks after start of CMV retinitis treatment to prevent immune recovery uveitis Pulmonary - Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) Presentation: fever, shortness of breath, cough (usually non-productive), sometimes night sweats and weight loss. Hypoxia out of proportion to exam. Evaluation: CT chest appearance usually bilateral and diffuse with GGOs and cystic lesions of varying size. Large cysts can rupture, causing pneumothorax. Induced sputum (or bronchoscopy sample) with cytology and GMS stain. Send serum LDH and 1,3-BD-glucan: should be elevated, but are nonspecific. Management: Bactrim is the preferred treatment; PO is preferable as Bactrim is 100% bioavailable. **If patient is hypoxic, need to consider of adding steroids, can measure A-a gradient. Alternative regimens may include primaquine + clindamycin or IV (NOT inhaled) pentamidine. - Pulmonary tuberculosis Presentation: With low CD4, can have upper lobe cavities but also atypical radiographic pattern, including a normal-appearing CXR. Have a high degree of suspicion in any patient with advanced HIV and respiratory complaints. Evaluation: TB skin tests and IGRAs have a high false negative rate in advanced HIV. At VUMC, any pt with HIV and respiratory complaints must be placed on airborne until TB ruleout- 3 sputum mycobacterial cultures collected at least 8 hours apart. If concentrated smear is negative x3, TB is unlikely (though have to follow up final culture to be sure). Management: RIPE therapy is the standard initial treatment, with adjustment if needed for drug resistance or contraindications - Herpes simplex tracheobronchitis and/or pneumonitis/pneumonia Evaluation: bronchoscopy with positive HSV PCR from BAL \u00b1 lung biopsy. (Usually associated with HSV-1) Management: agent and duration not well defined for bronchopulmonary disease; depending on severity of presentation, likely IV acyclovir to start followed by transition to PO antiviral once evidence of clinical improvement, for a total of 10-14 days. - Recurrent pneumonia NOS Histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, coccidiomycosis, and non-TB mycobacterial infections (including MAC) limited to the pulmonary system are not AIDs defining illnesses, though pts with advanced HIV and other severely immunosuppressed states are at higher risk. Gastrointestinal - Esophageal candidiasis Presentation: Dysphagia, odynophagia or both. Concurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis (\u201cthrush\u2019) is common but not universal. Evaluation: Typically presumptive. Treatment is the test; start fluconazole and consider EGD if symptoms do not improve after several days (in which case candidiasis may be severe, or it might not be the cause) Management: Fluconazole; nystatin is ineffective, especially in the severely immunocompromised - Herpes simplex esophagitis Evaluation: EGD shows diffuse ulcerations throughout the esophagus; in severe disease ulcers may coalesce into dark patches, \u201cblack esophagus.\u201d Esophageal biopsy is definitive, but can infer based on EGD appearance and serum studies. Management: Similar to other mucocutaneous infections, consider IV acyclovir at first and transition to PO once clinically improved - CMV esophagitis/enteritis/colitis Presentation: GI bleeding (colitis) or dysphagia and odynophagia (esophagitis) Evaluation: serum CMV PCR, consult GI for consideration of EGD/colonoscopy Management: (val)ganciclovir, foscarnet if ganciclovir resistance or contraindication - Chronic (>1 mo) intestinal isosporiasis Evaluation: Stool ova/parasite can capture Iospora belli (new name Cystoisospora belli), may need serial analysis due to intermittent shedding. Oocysts may also be seen on duodenal biopsy. Management: Bactrim; pyrimethamine + leucovorin if Bactrim is contraindicated - Chronic intestinal cryptosporidiosis Presentation: Diarrhea; may infect respiratory tract, causing nonproductive cough Evaluation: on GiPP or Cryptosporidium Ag Management: Early initiation or optimization of ART; Monotherapy with nitazoxanide is preferred; raising CD4 count >100 is necessary to cure infection - Recurrent salmonella septicemia Generally sensitive to fluoroquinolones, but if not clinically improving as expected you can request sensitivities from the microbiology lab. Neoplastic - Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma - Burkitt\u2019s, immunoblastic (subset of DLBCL), and 1\u00ba CNS - Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma Presentation: Distinctive mucocutaneous lesions, usually raised, papular, violaceous or darkly colored, non-tender and non-pruritic. Can also involve the visceral organs (esp lungs and GI tract) and deep lymphatic system. Evaluation: clinical, tissue biopsy for staging, HHV-8 serum PCR. Management: Limited mucocutaneous disease may resolve with initiation/optimization of ART, but widespread or resistant disease may require additional local therapies (ex radiation) or systemic chemo Bacillary angiomatosis (caused by Bartonella) may present similarly, but can be distinguished from KS on biopsy. It is neither a cancer nor an AIDS defining clinical condition, and is usually treated with doxycycline. - Cervical cancer Presentation, diagnosis, and treatment are essentially the same as in HIV-negative patients, but incidence is higher and disease progression is often more rapid Multisystem/Miscellaneous - Extrapulmonary or disseminated Mycobacterial infection (TB and non-TB) TB can go everywhere; some notable extrapulmonary sites include lymph nodes (e.g., scrofula), bones and joints (e.g., Pott\u2019s disease of the spine), pleura and pericardium, GU tract, and CNS. Dx can come from tissue culture and sometimes MTB PCR for more rapid detection (needs ID approval). TB-IRIS may be severe (esp with high infection burden) and hard to distinguish from TB treatment failure; can also be seen in adequately treated TB (provoked by the presence of dead bacteria) and undiagnosed latent TB. Disseminated MAC is usually diagnosed with AFB blood culture (only 1 positive needed). Think about it in patients with uncontrolled HIV and severe immunosuppression (esp CD4 \\<50), with unintentional weight loss, chronic diarrhea and/or dyspnea, and evidence of GI malabsorption or with bone marrow suppression - Extrapulmonary or disseminated Histoplasmosis, Cryptococcocosis, and Coccidiodomycosis Can be difficult to distinguish based on clinical presentation and imaging alone. Diagnosed by culture and/or antigen testing depending on the organism and site of infection, and diagnosis may be supported by serologic studies.

Amoxicillin -clavulanate: 500mg PO BID x5 days Ciprofloxacin : 250mg PO BID x3 days FQ\u2019s should be reserved for more serious infections than uncomplicated cystitis, and only after susceptibility results are confirmed given high rates of resistance from overuse (~25% of E. coli are resistant to ciprofloxacin at VUMC) Adverse effect profile >> beta-lactams (i.e. QT-prolongation, tendinopathies) Additional Information MDR cystitis: ESBL isolates are increasingly common due to antibiotic overuse Before treating, decide if this is a TRUE UTI If true, then for uncomplicated cystitis with ESBL organism, consider Fosfomycin (if E. coli ) or nitrofurantoin (if susceptibility is confirmed \u2013 K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp are usually resistant), or ID consultation Ask the lab to check susceptibility results to these antibiotics, for the future reference Complicated UTI and Pyelonephritis Background Fever , pyuria, and costovertebral angle tenderness suggest pyelonephritis. If any of the following are present, it is also considered a complicated UTI UTI with any of the following present: Renal calculi or other obstructive disease, Immunosuppressed host, abnormal urological anatomy or physiology, presence of a urinary catheter Evaluation - UA with reflex urine culture BCx and UCx prior to antibiotics If there is no pyuria, consider an alternative diagnosis, or proximal ureteral obstruction Pyuria is common in the presence of a urinary catheter, kidney stones, urostomy, ileal conduit and other invasive devices, and may not indicate infection Management Duration: 7-14 days, depending on antibiotic choice Follow up culture to confirm clearance, especially if outpatient Tailor therapy once/if cultures are available. If no improvement in 48h, consider imaging to rule out complications (e.g., perinephric abscess) 0 1 2 NaN First Line Alternative Outpatient Ciprofloxacin 750 BID (or 500 BID if bacteremia r/o) x 7d NaN Inpatient - CTX 2g q24h - Cefepime 2g q8h - Meropenem 2g q8h (if h/o or confirmed ESBL w/in last 90 d) - Ertapenem 1g q24 instead of Meropenem if no Pseudomonas - Ciprofloxacin 750 PO BID (500 PO BID if bacteremia ruled out) OR 400 IV BID (if suscept confirmed)* *FQ\u2019s have same bioavailability if given PO or IV so oral is preferred Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) Background Culture growth of > 10 3 cfu/mL of uropathogenic bacteria + signs or symptoms consistent with infection (without another identified etiology) + indwelling urethral/suprapubic catheter or intermittent catheterization. This includes pts with catheters in place during the preceding 48 hours Duration = greatest risk factor (Increases 3-10% per day of catheterization) Other risks: female sex, diabetes, elderly, colonization of catheter bag, poor care Bacteriuria, foul odor, pyuria, urine appearance and/or bacteriuria alone are not indicative of infection in patients who are otherwise asymptomatic. Ensure clean sample collected Ideally, catheter is removed and midstream sample obtained If catheterization required; removal of old catheter and sample taken from new Management - Distinguish uncomplicated vs complicated UTI (see above) Antimicrobial management: Guided by cultures and susceptibilities Empiric guidance as per management of uncomplicated/complicated UTI and per prior culture data/susceptibilities when available Duration: 7 \u2013 14 days depending on antibiotic, clinical response and whether infection constitutes complicated vs uncomplicated UTI Special note regarding Candida UTI management: Candida Is generally not pathogenic Presence in urine does not indicate infection (unless perinephric abscess, renal transplant, or complex fistulous disease) Fluconazole achieves excellent urinary penetration Echinocandins do not, and other azoles are not well studied in UTIs If fluconazole resistant Candida cultured or suspected, consult ID Susceptibilities are not routinely run on Candida from urine cultures and would need to be requested if concern for true infection. Catheter management At the least, catheters should be replaced at the time of antibiotic initiation Preferably, catheters should be removed If catheterization is necessary, intermittent catheterization is preferred over continuous use.

STAT consult to surgical service for emergent debridement (generally EGS vs ortho) Imaging does NOT rule out necrotizing fasciitis and should not delay these consultations ID consult Blood cultures, but this should not delay antibiotic administration Contact and droplet precautions x first 24h of abx therapy; after this, contact precautions only if draining or contained wounds Vancomycin + either piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375g IV q8h extended infusion OR cefepime 2gm IV q8h + clindamycin 600mg-900mg IV q8h (for antitoxin effects) Genitourinary Infection \u2013 VASP Asymptomatic Bacteriuria Background Isolation of bacteria in an appropriately collected urine specimen from an individual without symptoms or signs of urinary tract infection. Bacteriuria, foul odor, urine appearance, pyuria, falls and/or confusion alone are not indicative of infection. Oliguric ESRD patients may have bacteriuria from colonization due to lack of flushing of bladder; avoid sending UA/UCx unless patient is symptomatic Treatment only required for specific populations: Pregnant women (screening performed at 12 \u2013 16 weeks) Anticipated urologic intervention - when requesting, be sure to ask for Micro help in identifying potential pathogens needing treatment vs. likely contaminants Some renal transplant recipients, depending on time since transplant Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Background Clinical symptoms of UTI (dysuria/urgency/frequency/ hematuria) in non-pregnant, immunocompetent, neurologically intact pt with normal urologic anatomy and no indwelling urinary catheters Management Empiric therapy Nitrofurantoin monohydrate: 100 mg PO BID x 5 days (avoid if any concern for pyelonephritis or if creatinine clearance \\<60) Cephalexin 250-500mg q6h x5-7 days Alternative therapies Fosfomycin: 3 grams of powder mixed in water as a single PO dose (avoid if any concern for ascending UTI or pyelonephritis). Susceptibility test results must be requested of micro lab and are only possible for E. coli and E. Faecalis. Amoxicillin-clavulanate: 875-125mg PO BID x5 days Ciprofloxacin: 250mg PO BID x3 days FQ\u2019s should be reserved for more serious infections than uncomplicated cystitis, and only after susceptibility results are confirmed given high rates of resistance Adverse effect profile >> beta-lactams (i.e. QT-prolongation, tendinopathies) Avoid amoxicillin, ampicillin, and Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) due to increasing resistance unless culture data with confirmed susceptibility Additional Information MDR cystitis: ESBL isolates are increasingly common due to antibiotic overuse Before treating, decide if this is a TRUE UTI If true, consider Fosfomycin (if E. coli ) or nitrofurantoin (if susceptibility is confirmed \u2013 K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp are usually resistant), gentamicin or tobramycin 5-7mg/kg IV once, or ID consultation Ask the lab to check susceptibility results to these antibiotics for future reference Complicated UTI and Pyelonephritis Background Fever, pyuria, and costovertebral angle tenderness suggest pyelonephritis. Consider it a complicated UTI if any of the following are present: Renal calculi or other obstructive disease, immunosuppressed host, abnormal urological anatomy or physiology (including stents), presence of a urinary catheter Male sex alone does NOT qualify as complicated Evaluation UA with reflex urine culture BCx and UCx prior to antibiotics If there is no pyuria, consider an alternative diagnosis, or proximal ureteral obstruction Pyuria is common in the presence of a urinary catheter, kidney stones, urostomy, ileal conduit and other invasive devices, and may not indicate infection Management Antibiotic Duration: 7-14 days, depending on antibiotic choice Tailor therapy once/if cultures are available. If no improvement in 48h, consider imaging to rule out complications (e.g., perinephric abscess) First Line Alternative Outpatient Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 875-125mg BID x14 days Ciprofloxacin 750mg BID (or 500 BID if bacteremia ruled out) x 7 days Inpatient CTX 2g q24h Cefepime 2g q8h Pip/tazo (3.375g q6h or extended infusion of 3.375g q8h infused over 4h) IV Meropenem 1g q8h (if h/o or confirmed ESBL within the last 90 days) Ertapenem 1g q24 instead of Meropenem if no Pseudomonas Ciprofloxacin 750mg PO BID (500 mg PO BID if bacteremia ruled out) OR 400mg IV BID (if susceptibility confirmed)\\* *FQ\u2019s have same bioavailability if given PO or IV so oral is preferred Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) Background Culture growth of > 10 3 cfu/mL of uropathogenic bacteria + signs or symptoms consistent with infection (without another identified etiology) + indwelling urethral/suprapubic catheter or intermittent catheterization. This includes pts with catheters in place during the preceding 48 hours Duration = greatest risk factor (Increases 3-10% per day of catheterization) Other risks: female sex, diabetes, elderly, colonization of catheter bag, poor care Bacteriuria, foul odor, pyuria, urine appearance falls and/or confusion alone are not indicative of infection in patients who are otherwise asymptomatic. Ensure clean sample collected Ideally, catheter is removed and midstream sample obtained If catheterization required; removal of old catheter and sample taken from new catheter Management Distinguish uncomplicated vs complicated UTI (see above) Antimicrobial management: Guided by cultures and susceptibilities Empiric guidance as per management of uncomplicated/complicated UTI and per prior culture data/susceptibilities when available. Duration: 7 \u2013 14 days depending on antibiotic, clinical response and whether infection constitutes complicated vs uncomplicated UTI Special note regarding Candida UTI management: Candida is generally not pathogenic Presence in urine does not indicate infection (unless perinephric abscess, renal transplant, or complex fistulous disease) Fluconazole achieves excellent urinary penetration If fluconazole-resistant Candida is cultured or suspected, consult ID Susceptibilities are not routinely run-on Candida from urine cultures and would need to be requested if concern for true infection. Catheter management At the least, catheters should be replaced at the time of antibiotic initiation (preferably removed) If catheterization is necessary, intermittent catheterization is preferred over continuous use with patient educations on cleaning/hygiene prior to catheterization. Condom catheters and pure wicks also preferred over foley catheter Sexually Transmitted Infections \u2013 Ashley Zeoli Gonorrhea Background Cause: gram-negative coccus Neisseria gonorrhoeae Gonorrhea causes a spectrum of disease including urethritis, cervicitis, epididymitis, proctitis, pharyngeal infections, conjunctivitis, PID, and disseminated gonococcal infection Evaluation Microbial diagnosis is required to diagnose gonorrhea, rather than clinical diagnosis alone Test of choice: NAAT of the first-catch urine in men; NAAT of vaginal swab in women Also perform co-testing for chlamydia NAAT of pharyngeal or rectal swab should also be performed in patients with reported symptoms and recent sexual exposure. Note this is also routine testing in patients on PREP. Routine screening should be offered to sexually active patients, as many are asymptomatic Management Ceftriaxone is the only current antibiotic that meets the strict treatment efficacy goals with single-dose therapy. CTX also has a low rate of drug resistance, which is becoming an increasing issue in the treatment of gonorrhea. High dose IM ceftriaxone (\\<150kg 500mg IM; >150mg 1g IM) Same for pharyngitis or conjunctivitis CTX allergies: Azithromycin (2g PO x1) + Gentamicin (240mg IM x1) or Gemifloxacin Treatment of chlamydia must also be accompanied with gonorrhea treatment when it has not been excluded with molecular testing. Doxycycline 100mg BID for 7 days Patients who have persistent symptoms despite treatment should be suspected of having resistant gonorrhea. Test with culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (with or without NAAT). Patients with recurrent symptoms after period of resolution should be re-evaluated for gonorrhea and other STIs Chlamydia Background Cause: gram negative bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis Most individuals are asymptomatic though causes a wide array of infections: urethritis, cervicitis PID, conjunctivitis, perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome), pneumonia, proctitis, epididymitis, reactive arthritis, pharyngitis, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), endemic trachoma Differential diagnosis: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium Evaluation Test of choice: NAAT of vaginal swab in females (first catch urine also adequate); NAAT of first catch urine in males. NAATs can detect both LGV and non-LGV chlamydia trachomatis, but cannot distinguish between them Any patient with signs and symptoms concerning for chlamydia should be tested. Testing should also routinely be offered to sexually active individuals since most patients are asymptomatic. Note this is also routine testing in patients on PREP. Management Doxycycline 100mg BID x 7 days is the preferred treatment in non-pregnant patients (azithromycin is NOT preferred) Alternative treatment options (for allergies/severe contraindications): azithromycin (1g PO x 1), levofloxacin (500mg PO daily x7 days), and ofloxacin (300mg BID PO x7 days) Patients with recent potential or confirmed exposure within the last 1-2 weeks should be treated empirically Patients with persistent symptoms, confirmed infection, and who already underwent appropriate treatment, likely have a re-infection, rather than treatment failure. Test again. Patients with recurrent symptoms after resolution should be re-tested for chlamydia with a NAAT and other STIs (gonorrhea, BV, etc). Empiric therapy for gonorrhea should be given to patients unless NAAT is negative Syphilis Background Caused by the spirochete, Treponema pallidum, which is visualized by dark field microscopy High rate of HIV co-infection among MSM with syphilis (~42%) Transmitted by direct contact with an infectious lesion during sex. Infection can occur anywhere inoculation occurs (i.e. contact with infected secretions can result in a lesion on any tissue site) Can readily cross the placenta fetal infection Patients can present with a variety of symptoms, depending on their place in the disease course Evaluation Test all patients with signs and symptoms, as well as patients who are at increased risk for acquiring infection (patients with sexual partner with early syphilis, MSM, people living with HIV, high risk sexual behaviors, and history of commercial sex work or incarceration) HIV testing should be offered to all patients who test positive Pregnant patients should be screened for syphilis There are two types of serologic tests: treponemal-specific tests (FTA-ABS, MHA-TP, TPPA, TP-EIA, CIA) and nontreponemal tests (RPR, VDRL, TRUST). Either can be used as initial screening, but confirmatory testing with the other is needed due to false positives. Treponemal specific are usually used as confirmatory tests when nontreponemal tests are reactive. They are reported as reactive or non-reactive. Once positive, usually positive for life. Nontreponemal quantifies amount of antibody present and can be used to detect titers to assess for treatment. Titers should decline after a patient has been treated. A rise in titers in a previously treated patient should be concerning for new infection. Requires a humoral response, so can be false negatives if immunocompromised False positives: autoimmune diseases, pregnancy, other infections At VUMC, a positive treponemal IgG reflexes to a RPR titer. Neurosyphilis can occur at any time after infection. All newly diagnosed patients with syphilis should have a full neurologic exam and if any abnormalities should have an LP sent for CSF-VDRL. Any patients with syphilis and vision changes should get an ophthalmology evaluation. + Treponemal - Treponemal + Non-treponemal Diagnostic of syphilis (completely new, or potentially re-infected) Likely false positive - Non-treponemal Likely history of successfully treated syphilis Likely not syphilis, or false negative (due to prozone\\* effect) \\*Prozone effect: when there is an overabundance of antibodies and they interfere with clumping/formation of antigen-antibody complex so agglutination cannot be visualized Management To assess treatment efficacy, we want to see a fourfold decrease in titer after treatment Symptoms Treatment Treatment Alternatives Primary Painless chancre at inoculation site with regional lymphadenopathy PCN G benzathine 2.4 million units IM x1 Doxycycline 100mg PO BID x 14 days OR Ceftriaxone 1-2g daily IM or IV x 10-14 days OR Tetracycline 500mg PO QID x 14 days OR Amoxicillin 3g BID and probenecid 500mg BID x 14 days Secondary Systemic illness with rash (palms, soles), fever, malaise, alopecia, hepatitis, mucous patches, condyloma, pharyngitis Early Latent Infected, but no symptoms.

Consider albuterol inhaler for wheezing No indication for antibiotics Influenza Background Dx often clinical w/cough, sore throat, #sputum/nasal discharge, HA, fever, myalgias, and malaise; \u00b1 N/V/D. Exam with increased flushing, rarely with lower respiratory symptoms Evaluation During flu season: Obtain COVID/RPP or dedicated influenza PCR; testing is more accurate if obtained within 96 hour of symptom onset CXR if concerned for bacterial superinfection Management Antivirals most effective when given \\<48 hours from symptom onset; however, recommended to be given if symptomatic despite duration and to all hospitalized patients Oseltamivir 75mg BID x 5 days, peramivir 600mg IV x 1 (needs renal adjustment), or baloxavir (age \u226512) 40mg once (use 80 mg if >80kg) Amantadine and rimantadine are no longer used due to emerging resistance Inpatient COVID-19 Management \u2013 Kathryn Snyder Background COVID-19 is the novel coronavirus responsible for the ongoing pandemic that started in late 2019. The virus has ongoing mutations resulting in new dominant strains. Evaluation Please see the most updated VUMC and VA guidance due to frequently evolving recommendations. Please refer to the hospital\u2019s current maximum oxygen requirement allowed on the floor to ensure patient is appropriately triaged. Basic admission workup for symptomatic, confirmed COVID-19 Labs: CBC with diff, CMP, d-dimer, ferritin, CRP, ESR, PT/INR, PTT, procalcitonin, RPP Imaging: portable CXR Nursing: Strict I/O Enhanced precautions (contact, airborne, eye protection) Management Fluid balance goal slightly net negative to even Anticoagulation/DVT prophylaxis: Please see latest VUMC or VA guidance based on clinical status (supplemental O2 requirements, ICU vs floor, etc.) Pharmacologic therapies Note: Therapies, indications, and contraindications are frequently changing, please see latest VUMC/VA guidelines for specific indications for these medications or others Remdesivir Loading dose 200mg IV x1 then 100mg daily x 4 days For use in patients hospitalized for COVID within 7 days of symptom onset Contraindications: known hypersensitivity, ALT >/= 10x ULN, high-flow NC, PPV, intubated, or on ECMO Monitoring: baseline CBC, INR, q48h CMP Dexamethasone 6mg PO/IV x 10 days; consideration of longer taper if no clinical improvement or persistently elevated CRP Contraindications: no hard contraindications, use clinical judgement if concomitant serious bacterial/fungal infection Antibiotics: The incidence of superimposed bacterial infection in the setting of COVID-19 is low The majority of patients do not need additional coverage for bacterial pneumonia You can use procalcitonin to guide decision Other pharmacologic therapies include baricitinib (JAK inhibitor), tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) and monoclonal antibodies Additional Information Complications and special considerations for COVID-19 patients High PE/DVT risk Superimposed bacterial PNA AKI GI symptoms/abnormalities (see GI section on COVID-19) Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) Background All PNA that does not otherwise meet criteria for Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (PNA that develops \u226548 hours after hospital admission), Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (PNA that develops \u226548-72 hours after endotracheal intubation), or aspiration PNA Healthcare-associated pneumonia is no longer a clinical entity per 2016 IDSA guidelines MRSA Risk Factors: recent history, cavitary lesion, post-influenza bacterial PNA, pts with IDU, severe hypoxemia requiring intubation Pseudomonas : Double coverage is not indicated in general population; LVQ has 82% sensitivity so not recommended unless isolate proven susceptible Evaluation Sputum cultures prior to abx, consider BCx in select groups (severe pneumonia, ICU admission, cavitary disease, immunosuppression). Rule out flu if the right season, COVID-19, consider RVP if it will change management CURB-65 or PSI can aid in decision between outpatient vs inpatient therapy CURB65: Confusion, Uremia (BUN >=19 mg/dL), RR (>30/min), BP(\\<90/60 mmHg), Age \u2265 65 If \u2265 2, hospitalization is recommended. Consider urine pneumococcal Ag, urine Legionella Ag in severe CAP and in certain pts (e.g., neutropenia, asplenia, obstructive lung disease, hyponatremia, diarrhea, or heavy alcohol use); these are performed at reference labs and will take several days to return. CRP, ESR, and pro-calcitonin have not been shown to reliably improve outcomes; however, pro-calcitonin \\< 0.25 suggests against bacterial respiratory infection and antibiotic discontinuation is encouraged PA/ lateral CXR to evaluate for and localize infiltrate. If immunocompromised, consider CT chest w/o contrast (does not improve outcomes) Lobar Consolidation - likely bacterial Interstitial Infiltrate - likely atypical vs. viral vs. non-infectious Cavitation - concerning for fungal vs. necrotizing vs. mycobacterial Management Antibiotic Duration: 5-7 days (at least 5 days and improvement with clinical stability) Outpatient Inpatient (Non- ICU & ICU) No MRSA or Pseudomonas suspected Low Risk\\*: -Amoxicillin 1g TID High Risk: -Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 BID + Macrolide -Cefdinir 300 BID + Macrolide -Amoxicillin 1g TID + Macrolide -Levofloxacin 750 daily CTX 2g q24 + Azithromycin 500 daily OR Levofloxacin 750 daily MRSA or Pseudomonas suspected MRSA: Vancomycin OR Linezolid (if no bacteremia) Pseudomonas: Cefepime 2g q8h *No chronic heart, lung, liver, renal disease, DM, alcoholism, immunocompromise Additional Information MRSA nasal swab has reported negative predictive value for MRSA pneumonia ranging 95% to >99%; consider sending and if negative, discontinue MRSA agent CTX is generally adequate coverage for aspiration PNA without evidence of abscess, empyema, or cavitary lesion on imaging Aspiration pneumonia can be confused for aspiration pneumonitis which does not need to be treated with antibiotics. Rapid resolution of leukocytosis and stabilization of vitals suggest aspiration pneumonitis and consideration of stopping antibiotics. There is low sensitivity of S. pneumoniae to azithromycin (42%) and doxycycline (72%), so these should not be used as monotherapy Check for drug interactions with linezolid (e.g., SSRI, methadone, methamphetamine use) Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) and Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) Background HAP: Pneumonia that develops >48 hours after admission VAP: Pneumonia that develops >48 hours after endotracheal intubation Evaluation Cultures of blood, sputum, endotracheal aspirate and/or bronchoscopy specimen Consider MRSA nares to help with de-escalation If there is concern for respiratory viruses: send influenza, COVID, RVP Management Initially cover for MRSA and Pseudomonas Antibiotic Duration: 7 days in uncomplicated cases, although specific pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas ) may require longer duration and ID guidance Consider ID consultation if the patient is not clinically improving on empiric therapy or if an MDR pathogen grows from culture If no MRSA isolated and pt is improving, consider stopping vancomycin ASAP There is concern for nephrotoxicity with combination Vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, but data controversial MRSA Coverage Pseudomonas Coverage First Line Vancomycin (Pharmacy dosing) Cefepime 2g q8h OR Piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 q8h extended infusion OR Ceftazidime 2g q8h Alternative Vancomycin allergy: Linezolid 600 mg PO q12h True PCN allergy: Aztreonam 2g q8h Diabetic Foot Infection \u2013 VASP Evaluation Plain radiograph for all pts; MRI w/contrast if abscess/osteo suspected BCx (prior to antibiotics) if systemic signs of infection, or severe infection Do not culture swabs of lesions, as these generally only grow colonizing organisms. Consult podiatry if osteomyelitis present for bone specimen culture and pathology (either from debridement specimen or bone biopsy) prior to starting antibiotics. Consult surgery if concern for abscess, gas in tissue, joint involvement Assess peripheral vasculature, consider arterial flow studies/vascular surgery consult Management Assess Severity: Mild: Local infxn, skin/subQ tissue only, erythema >0.5 cm but \u22642cm from ulcer Moderate: Local infxn w/erythema > 2 cm from ulcer or deeper structures included without SIRS Severe: Local infxn with systemic inflammation as evidenced by >2 SIRS criteria Consider anti-pseudomonal coverage if at risk for Pseudomonas infection (e.g. wet; failure of prior antibiotic therapy; chronic wound).

Most diabetic foot infections are polymicrobial in nature. Culture results may guide therapy, but all pathogens identified may not require treatment. Joint Infections and Osteomyelitis \u2013 VASP Evaluation Blood cultures prior to antibiotics MRI is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for osteomyelitis. Ortho consult for joint fluid aspirate or bone bx; send for culture and send fluid for cell count/differential. Management Hold antibiotics until culture obtained, if patient is clinically stable Osteomyelitis is a 6-week treatment course, can consider early transition (at 2-3 weeks) to oral if good bioavailability and susceptibility. For prosthetic joint infection, procedure/retention of hardware determines duration First line empiric: Vancomycin + ciprofloxacin 750mg BID Antimicrobial therapy will ultimately be guided by culture data, ID consult recommended for joint infection treatment due to need for prolonged antibiotic therapy Bacteremia: Interpreting GenMark ePlex\u00ae Results \u2013 VASP Background When BCx turn positive, the lab reports Gram stain and GenMark ePlex\u00ae results to help guide empiric therapy, while awaiting further species identification and susceptibilities.

Endocarditis patients should be on telemetry, monitored closely by team. CXR: infiltrates suggestive of septic pulmonary emboli, pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly Imaging of distant affected site if concerned for septic emboli Other advanced imaging in select scenario: cardiac CTA, cardiac MRI, FDG-PET/CT Management Empiric antibiotics: If bacteria isolated from blood, reference bacteremia section for abx choice If awaiting cultures Native valve: Vancomycin \u00b1 GNR coverage (depending on clinical stability, risk factors, etc.) Prosthetic valve: Vancomycin and cefepime, consider gentamicin Antibiotic Duration: determined by ID, often 4-6 weeks Cardiac surgery consult: if valve dysfunction, perivalvular abscess, large (>20mm) vegetations, heart block, ongoing embolization on abx, delayed Cx clearance (>1 week on abx) Additional Information: Complications: Cardiac: Heart failure: usually secondary to valve dysfunction. Most common when aortic valve involved, risk also depends on organism (worst is Staph aureus ) Perivalvular abscess: suspect when there are conduction abnormalities on EKG. Pericarditis: can be suppurative or non-suppurative Intracardiac Fistula Septic emboli and metastatic abscesses Mycotic aneurysm: usually occurs at vessel branch points Follow Up Repeat TTE at completion of treatment to establish new baseline Followed for valvular dysfunction with frequency determined by nature of the dysfunction Regular dental care; prior IE is an indication for SBE prophylaxis with dental work. Episode of IE is an indication for PDA or VSD closure Central Nervous System Infection \u2013 VASP Bacterial Meningitis Evaluation Blood cultures prior to antibiotics if possible Head CT pre-LP, only if: Immunocompromised, hx of CNS diseases (shunts, trauma, tumors), papilledema on exam or FND, AMS, or new onset seizure. If there is a delay in obtaining head CT or LP, DO NOT delay antibiotics. Lumbar puncture (See Procedures Section): Obtain: Opening pressure, cell count + differential, glucose, protein, bacterial culture Send an extra tube or two of CSF to the lab, if possible, to be frozen in case extra testing is needed (Order \u2018Miscellaneous test\u2019 and for test name put \u201cPlease freeze CSF in virology;\u201d reference lab: VUMC, specimen type: CSF) Additional studies to consider in select pts: HSV 1, 2 PCR (NOT antibodies), VZV PCR, VDRL, Crypto Ag, fungal and/or AFB cultures, MTB PCR, West Nile Virus Ab, Enterovirus PCR, Histoplasma Ag, or Biofire Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel. These should not be performed routinely on all patients and consult ID where management questions exist. If Biofire Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel is performed, double check what is included to avoid sending duplicate individual tests (ie HSV, VZV, enterovirus, etc.) A negative cryptococcus on Biofire does not exclude disease (CSF Crypto Ag is more sensitive) Management ANTIBIOTICS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE: Ceftriaxone 2g IV q12h + Vancomycin, adjusted for renal function Piperacillin-tazobactam cannot be used due to poor CNS penetration IV ampicillin 2g q4h for optional coverage of Listeria for immunocompromised patients, pregnant women, or age >50 (adjust based on renal function) IV acyclovir 10 mg/kg (based on adjusted body weight) q8h, if suspected HSV or VZV meningitis, make sure to run with adequate pre-hydration with NS Consider empiric PO/IV doxycycline 100mg BID if tick-borne illness is suspected Steroids: Based on IDSA guidelines, steroids (dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg q6h) should be given about 10-20 minutes before the first dose of antibiotics, or at the same time, in patients with suspected bacterial meningitis. IF pneumococcus is isolated, continue IV steroids for 2-4 days; otherwise, can discontinue ID consultation: Duration should be guided by ID and varies based on organism recovered Encephalitis Background The presence or absence of normal brain function/cognition is the important distinguishing clinical feature between encephalitis and meningitis Evaluation MRI more sensitive that CT, although imaging may or may not demonstrate abnormal radiographic findings in patients with encephalitis LP \u2013 similar studies as for meningitis (see above) + BioFire MEP for ALL pts Management Acyclovir 10mg/kg IV q8hr, consideration of antibacterial therapy if unable to conclusively exclude a bacterial meningitis, consideration of doxycycline if tick-borne infection is on the differential, and further treatment as guided by ID ID consult is strongly encouraged for all patients with suspected encephalitis Brain Abscess Evaluation/Management Consult: Neurosurgery and ID Blood Cultures, HIV testing in any patient with a brain lesion Empiric antibiotics: IV Vancomycin (target trough 15 - 20 mcg/mL) + ceftriaxone 2g IV q12h + metronidazole 500mg IV/PO q6h If concern for extension from otitis externa, use an antipseudomonal cephalosporin (cefepime 2g IV Q8h) instead of ceftriaxone Brain abscesses generally polymicrobial, thus broad-spectrum antibiotics indicated Aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracyclines (e.g. doxycycline), clindamycin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase combinations (e.g., Zosyn) and 1 st -generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefazolin) should NOT be used as they do not cross BBB at high concentration. Antibiotic Duration: Based on surgical drainage and Infectious Diseases guidance Epidural Abscess Management If spinal lesion, consult \u2018Spine surgery\u2019 and it will be directed to Ortho-Spine or Neurosurgery, depending on who is on call. Antibiotics should be started as soon as the diagnosis of epidural abscess is suspected, immediately following the collection of two sets of blood cultures Vancomycin 15-20mg/kg IV q8-12h (adjusted for renal function) + ceftriaxone 2g IV q24h (or q12hr if there is secondary meningitis) Use cefepime 2g IV q8h instead of ceftriaxone if concern for Pseudomonas ID consult is strongly encouraged and they will guide duration Fungal Infections \u2013 Justin Smith Histoplasmosis Background Endemic to Ohio and Mississippi river valley Pulmonary infiltrate with hilar or mediastinal LAD, pulmonary nodule/cavitary lesion, pulmonary syndrome with erythema nodosum DDx: TB, malignancy, sarcoidosis (if considering sarcoidosis, rule out histoplasmosis as sarcoidosis treatment can induce disseminated histoplasmosis) Evaluation Antigen (requires attending approval): For acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, 65% urine sensitivity, 69% serum sensitivity, and 83% sensitivity when co-tested. Thus, both serum and urine Ag are usually sent together Lower rates of positivity when disease is localized, versus diffuse throughout the lungs or disseminated. There are relatively high rates of cross-reactivity, where histoplasma antigen will be positive with blastomycosis; therefore, do not order blasto Ag if ordering histo Ag in MOST cases Serology: Consider Histoplasma Ab if evaluating for pulmonary disease Culture: most useful in chronic infections, sensitivity is low in acute/localized and may take >6 weeks to grow. Bronchoscopy: If clinical suspicion is high and work up negative, consider interventional pulmonology consult for consideration of bronchoscopy Management Outpatient/Mild disease: Tx not required if symptoms \\<4 weeks, initiate if symptomatic beyond 4 weeks Itraconazole: 200mg TID x3 days loading, then BID (adjusted by levels which are drawn 2 weeks post-start) for 6-12 weeks minimum Can use oral formulation or capsules (capsules require high acidity, give with food consumption or OJ or coke; do not use capsules if patient is on H2 blockers/PPI) Voriconazole, Posaconazole: used if not tolerating itraconazole or as salvage therapy Inpatient/Moderate to Severe Disease: Amphotericin: 1-2 weeks induction, followed by PO itraconazole for 12 weeks (total) Methylprednisolone: help to prevent ARDS with significant lung involvement Additional Information Complications: Pericarditis, arthritis/arthralgias with erythema nodosum, chronic cavitary lesions, fibrosing mediastinitis, broncholithiasis Disseminated Histoplasmosis: Typically found in immunocompromised populations Clinical presentations: FUO, weight loss, disseminated LAD, cutaneous manifestations, bone marrow suppression/pancytopenia, liver enzymes elevation, various solid organ involvement on imaging (liver, spleen, adrenals, nodes) Management Mild: itraconazole Moderate to Severe: amphotericin induction followed by itraconazole CNS involvement: amphotericin for 4-6 weeks as induction Blastomycosis Background Endemic to Mississippi/Ohio river valley, southern and midwestern US, great lakes Pulmonary syndrome: cough, fever, hemoptysis, chest pain, dyspnea Can result in both an acute or chronic pneumonia, as well as ARDS Cutaneous: raised verrucous lesion, varying in color, with irregular borders MSK: osteolytic lesion, draining sinus, soft tissue swelling Multi-system: up to 20-40% of cases, most typically lung/skin involvement. Evaluation Culture: typically takes 1-4 weeks Ag: urine >serum. ~90% sensitive, but only 80% specific because of cross-reactivity Serology: available, but not very useful because of high degree of cross-reactivity Management Mild: PO itraconazole for 6-12 months with loading, check level at 2 weeks Moderate to Severe: induction with Amphotericin, followed by 6-12 months of PO itraconazole Candida Background Oropharyngeal: white plaques in mouth, change in taste, erythema without plaques Usually seen in infants, older adults, immunocompromised host (HIV or chemotherapy), inhaled steroid users Esophageal: odynophagia, especially retrosternal pain (AIDS defining illness) Vulvovaginitis: itching, burning, vaginal discharge, vulvar erythema, vulvar edema, dyspareunia, dysuria Balanitis: painful white plaques with burning and itching on the glans penis Mastitis: erythema, tenderness in breast feeding woman. Management Depends on specifics, but typically nystatin or fluconazole EXCEPT C. glabrata (proof of fluconazole susceptibility needed) and C. krusei (intrinsically resistant to fluconazole) Cx generally not indicated unless complicated pt with extensive tx history for Candida Additional Information Disseminated disease Presentation: Primarily immunocompromised populations (hematologic malignancies, solid organ transplant recipients, receiving chemotherapy, TPN, steroid use, broad spectrum antibiotics) and ICU settings (especially, burn, trauma, and neonatal) Diagnosis: Candida in a bacterial blood culture (NEVER contaminant) Start micafungin 100mg IV and consult ID for candidemia or if concerned for disseminated disease HIV/AIDS and ART \u2013 Kathryn Snyder and Quinton Taylor Background Why is ART important? Clear morbidity and mortality benefits across all CD4 counts Decreases subsequent infections (both common and opportunistic) Decreased HIV related comorbid conditions, viral reservoirs, and transmission New HIV Diagnosis ID consult if patient is not on Rogers ID service (important for initiation, follow up [CCC], social work assistance) ART is indicated for all HIV+ patients, regardless of CD4; however, starting ART requires appropriate outpatient follow up Lab evaluation: HIV viral load, genotype, and resistance testing T cell subsets (CD4 Count), CBC with differential, CMP, UA HLA*B5701 testing before using abacavir containing regimen QuantiFERON Gold Pregnancy testing Viral hepatitis serologies Toxoplasma serologies Other STI screening (Syphilis, Gonorrhea/Chlamydia) Timing of ART initiation Factors affecting timing of initiation Drug toxicity and interactions, risks for resistance, adherence barriers Treatment of opportunistic infections may delay initiation of ART given associated risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) Delay ART for several weeks after initiation of therapy for cryptococcal meningitis, tuberculosis, and CMV retinitis ART plan for overnight admits: okay to continue home ART, special consideration for: Patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction may need dose adjustment Interactions with other newly initiated medications If there is concern for non-adherence, can hold morning dose Combination pills may need to be ordered as separate components Common key regimens for initiation Most regimens consist of an NRTI backbone (2 agents) plus a 3 rd agent Some dual therapy regimens (such as Dovato@) are non-inferior to standard 3-drug therapy Many patients are started on combination pill regimens, including Integrase Inhibitor based regimens: Biktarvy\u00ae, Dovato\u00ae, Triumeq\u00ae, Genvoya\u00ae, dolutegravir + Descovy\u00ae AIDS Defining Clinical Conditions \u2013 Rebecca Choudhury AIDS is defined by HIV infection with concurrent absolute CD4 count \\<200, CD4 percentage \\<14%, or one of the following conditions (predominately opportunistic infections and HIV associated malignancies): Neurologic/Ophthalmologic CNS toxoplasmosis Presentation: Variable, depending on disease burden/location, may include AMS, headache, seizure, ataxia, and focal neurologic deficits, \u00b1 fever and flu-like symptoms Evaluation: MRI w/ring-enhancing lesions on brain imaging, serum Toxoplasma IgG/IgM and (ideally) CSF Toxoplasma PCR (though CSF Toxoplasma PCR has a low sensitivity). Response to empiric therapy (~90% will have radiographic improvement after 14 days) can also be diagnostic. Brain biopsy may be indicated if diagnostic uncertainty. Management: Pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin is the preferred regimen, discuss dosing with pharmacy. Alternative regimens: clindamycin, Bactrim, atovaquone Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) Presentation: chronic (weeks to months), progressive neurologic dysfunction, particularly incoordination and other motor dysfunction, aphasia, sometimes cognitive impairment and personality changes Evaluation: MRI brain w/patchy areas of demyelination in the subcortical white matter; location is variable, but parietal, occipital, and cerebellar involvement are common. JC virus PCR from CSF. Brain biopsy. Management: Initiation of ART (there is no specific JC virus-directed therapy), IRIS may occur in which case clinical worsening before improvement may be seen. Fatal if HIV goes untreated. HIV-related encephalopathy Presentation: Similar to other progressive dementias, with short term memory loss followed by worsening global cognitive dysfunction, motor deficits, sometimes seizures in late stages Evaluation: MRI w/diffuse cerebral atrophy and/or demyelinating lesions similar to PML. CSF w/elevated protein \u00b1 lymphocytic pleocytosis, with no alternative cause. Send HIV RNA from the CSF, usually + in HIV encephalopathy Cryptococcal meningitis Presentation: Subacute to chronically worsening HA and fevers; meningismus and photophobia may be present but are often absent; rarely, focal neurologic deficits Evaluation: LP to check opening pressure and can send serum and CSF Cryptococcus Ag. Brain imaging may be non-diagnostic Treatment: Induction therapy with amphotericin and flucytosine x14 days (at least), with repeat LP close to end of induction to confirm CSF inflammation is improving and fungal culture is negative. Consolidation therapy consists of high dose fluconazole for at least 8 weeks, followed by maintenance therapy with fluconazole for one year. Pts may require serial LP or VP shunt to manage ICP. Delay ART for several weeks after start of treatment to avoid risk of IRIS. CMV retinitis (with vision loss) Presentation: Blurry vision, focal blind spots, visual field deficits, or scotomas and floaters. Typically begins unilateral, though often progresses to bilateral involvement. Evaluation: Always consult ophtho if you suspect it! May cause complete retinal detachment. Check serum CMV PCR (or vitreous if able) Management: PO valgancyclovir (+intravitreous ganciclovir or foscarnet in severe disease). If not on ART, must delay ART for at least 2 weeks after start of CMV retinitis treatment to prevent immune recovery uveitis Pulmonary Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) Presentation: fever, shortness of breath, cough (usually non-productive), sometimes night sweats and weight loss. Hypoxia out of proportion to exam. Evaluation: CT chest appearance usually bilateral and diffuse with GGOs and cystic lesions of varying size. Large cysts can rupture, causing pneumothorax. Transbronchial biopsy, BAL, or induced sputum with cytology and GMS stain. Sputum Pneumocystis PCR can be done, but this is a send-out with long turn-around-time Consider serum LDH and 1,3-BD-glucan: should be elevated, but are nonspecific. Management: Bactrim is the preferred treatment; PO is preferable as Bactrim is 100% bioavailable. Check ABG on ROOM AIR to consider of adding adjunctive steroids (If A-a gradient >/=35mmHg and/or PaO2 \\<70mmHg). Alternative regimens may include primaquine + clindamycin or IV (NOT inhaled) pentamidine. Pulmonary tuberculosis Presentation: With low CD4, can have upper lobe cavities but also atypical radiographic pattern, including a normal-appearing CXR. Have a high degree of suspicion in any patient with advanced HIV and respiratory complaints. Evaluation: TB skin tests and IGRAs have a high false negative rate in advanced HIV. At VUMC, any pt with HIV and respiratory complaints must be placed on airborne until TB ruleout- 3 sputum mycobacterial cultures collected at least 8 hours apart. If concentrated smear is negative x3, TB is unlikely (though have to follow up final culture to be sure). Management: RIPE therapy is the standard initial treatment, with adjustment if needed for drug resistance or contraindications Herpes simplex tracheobronchitis and/or pneumonitis/pneumonia Evaluation: bronchoscopy with positive HSV PCR from BAL \u00b1 lung biopsy. (Usually associated with HSV-1) Management: agent and duration not well defined for bronchopulmonary disease; depending on severity of presentation, likely IV acyclovir to start followed by transition to PO antiviral once evidence of clinical improvement, for a total of 10-14 days. Gastrointestinal Esophageal candidiasis Presentation: Dysphagia, odynophagia or both. Concurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis (\u201cthrush\u2019) is common but not universal. Evaluation: Typically presumptive. Treatment is the test; start fluconazole and consider EGD if symptoms do not improve after several days (in which case candidiasis may be severe, or it might not be the cause) Management: Fluconazole; nystatin is ineffective, especially in the severely immunocompromised Herpes simplex esophagitis Evaluation: EGD shows diffuse ulcerations throughout the esophagus; in severe disease ulcers may coalesce into dark patches, \u201cblack esophagus.\u201d Esophageal biopsy is definitive, but can infer based on EGD appearance and serum studies. Management: Similar to other mucocutaneous infections, consider IV acyclovir at first and transition to PO once clinically improved CMV esophagitis/enteritis/colitis Presentation: GI bleeding (colitis) or dysphagia and odynophagia (esophagitis) Evaluation: serum CMV PCR, consult GI for consideration of EGD/colonoscopy Management: (val)ganciclovir, foscarnet if ganciclovir resistance or contraindication Chronic (>1 mo) intestinal isosporiasis Evaluation: Stool ova/parasite can capture Iospora belli (new name Cystoisospora belli), may need serial analysis due to intermittent shedding. Oocysts may also be seen on duodenal biopsy. Management: Bactrim; pyrimethamine + leucovorin if Bactrim is contraindicated Chronic intestinal cryptosporidiosis Presentation: Diarrhea; may infect respiratory tract, causing nonproductive cough Evaluation: on GiPP or Cryptosporidium Ag Management: Early initiation or optimization of ART; Monotherapy with nitazoxanide is preferred; raising CD4 count >100 is necessary to cure infection Recurrent Salmonella septicemia Generally sensitive to fluoroquinolones, but if not clinically improving as expected you can request sensitivities from the microbiology lab. Neoplastic Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma DLBCL, Burkitt\u2019s, immunoblastic (subset of DLBCL), primary effusion lymphoma, and 1\u00ba CNS Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma Presentation: Distinctive mucocutaneous lesions, usually raised, papular, violaceous or darkly colored, non-tender and non-pruritic. Can also involve the visceral organs (esp lungs and GI tract) and deep lymphatic system. Evaluation: clinical, tissue biopsy for staging, HHV-8 serum PCR. Management: Limited mucocutaneous disease may resolve with initiation/optimization of ART, but widespread or resistant disease may require additional local therapies (eg: radiation) or systemic chemo Bacillary angiomatosis (caused by Bartonella) may present similarly, but can be distinguished from KS on biopsy. It is neither a cancer nor an AIDS defining clinical condition, and is usually treated with doxycycline. Cervical cancer Presentation, diagnosis, and treatment are essentially the same as in HIV-negative patients, but incidence is higher and disease progression is often more rapid Multisystem/Miscellaneous Extrapulmonary or disseminated Mycobacterial infection (TB and non-TB) TB can go everywhere; some notable extrapulmonary sites include lymph nodes (e.g., scrofula), bones and joints (e.g., Pott\u2019s disease of the spine), pleura and pericardium, GU tract, and CNS. Dx can come from tissue culture and sometimes MTB PCR for more rapid detection (needs ID approval). TB-IRIS may be severe (esp with high infection burden) and hard to distinguish from TB treatment failure; can also be seen in adequately treated TB (provoked by the presence of dead bacteria) and undiagnosed latent TB. Disseminated MAC is usually diagnosed with AFB blood culture (only 1 positive needed). Think about it in patients with uncontrolled HIV and severe immunosuppression (esp CD4 \\<50), with unintentional weight loss, chronic diarrhea and/or dyspnea, and evidence of GI malabsorption or with bone marrow suppression Extrapulmonary or disseminated Histoplasmosis, Cryptococcocosis, and Coccidiodomycosis Can be difficult to distinguish based on clinical presentation and imaging alone. Diagnosed by culture and/or antigen testing depending on the organism and site of infection, and diagnosis may be supported by serologic studies.

Normal kidney function: incidence of CI-AKI is 1-3% Pre-existing CKD: Incidence of CI-AKI may be as high as 20% in patients with CKD 4-5 Other risk factors include: diabetes, heart failure, and advanced age No real sCr or eGFR threshold below which iodinated contrast is contraindicated, especially in patients for whom imaging will alter management (e.g. acute stroke, PE, STEMI) Risk reduction strategies Volume expansion with isotonic crystalloid (PRESERVE Trial) in patients with AKI or eGFR \\<30 ml/min/1.73m^2 who are clinically hypo or euvolemic 1cc/kg/hr for 6-12 hours before/during and 6-12 hours after the procedure in patients at high risk for CI-AKI.

(Evidence: FIDELIO) Dialysis initiation Early (CKD3a or 3b) referral to nephrology has better outcomes Uremic symptoms: fatigue, sleep disturbance, N/V, decreased appetite, dysgeusia, itching, hiccupping Refractory hyper K Refractory hypertension Plot your patient\u2019s eGFR using the graph function in EPIC or CPRS to determine trajectory (normal age-related decline after age 60 is ~ 1ml/min/m2) Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) Basics \u2013 Daniel Motta Background/Terminology Dialysis (diffusive clearance)- solutes diffuse down concentration gradients through a semipermeable membrane separating blood and dialysate Dialysate (dialysis bath)- electrolyte solution used to create concentration gradient for dialysis. Customizable to treat specific electrolyte and acid-base derangements Effluent - Fluid removed during dialysis or ultrafiltration Ultrafiltration- Hydrostatic pressure \u201cpushing\u201d water through a membrane. There is no dialysate solution used during ultrafiltration. Solutes are removed through the process of solvent drag. The effluent in this case is isotonic to plasma Total ultrafiltration (UF) - overall ultrafiltration volume produced during treatment UF net - net ultrafiltrate volume removed from the patient by the machine. The overall volume can be completely replaced (net even), partially replaced, or not replaced at all. UF net is the difference between UF and the volume replaced in the circuit Timing of dialysis - There are several studies in this space (IDEAL, IDEAL-ICU, AKIKI, STARRT, ELAINE). In both the outpatient and the inpatient setting, there is no compelling evidence that early start dialysis improves mortality compared to later starts Outpatient Modalities Intermittent hemodialysis (iHD) In home hemodialysis Peritoneal dialysis If someone with ESRD is admitted: Urgent ESRD consult if acute need, otherwise can consult them routinely Routine orders include MWF phos checks and a renal diet For peritoneal dialysis pts, their diet can be more liberal and include low phos only or even regular diet (Can just ask what diet he/she follows at home) Acute Setting Indications: AKI leading to life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance or toxic ingestion [AEIOU] Acidosis: Severe metabolic acidosis (serum pH\\<7.1) refractory to correcting volume status or other electrolyte derangements Electrolytes: Severe hyperkalemia >6.5 despite medical management (e.g. loop diuretics, IV fluids, GI cation exchangers, correcting acidemia, etc.) Intoxication: Dialyzable toxins and medications Alcohols: ethylene glycol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, diethylene glycol, and propylene glycol Medications: lithium, salicylates, valproic acid, phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, vancomycin, aminoglycosides, etc. Overload: Severe fluid overload (e.g., pulmonary edema) refractory to diuretics Uremia: Uremic complications: encephalopathy, pericarditis, platelet dysfunction Can perform furosemide stress test to help predict who is likely to recover their kidney function If Lasix na\u00efve, administer 1mg/kg as a bolus. If on a loop diuretic, administer 1.5 mg/kg as a bolus If within the hour they have made 200 cc of urine, then they are likely to regain kidney function Modalities iHD: Ideal for removal of toxins (e.g. alcohols, dialyzable meds). Use with caution in hypotensive patients CRRT: Set a rate of volume removal (typically 0-200 cc/hr) less rapid fluid/electrolytes shifts better tolerated in patients with hemodynamic instability Anti-coagulation options- to prevent clotting of circuit None Heparin (preferred). Can be either within the circuit or systemic if indicated for another reason (e.g. DVT/PE). Citrate (need to monitor calcium frequently) Complications of CRRT: Infections, hypophosphatemia Access Dialysis catheter (aka: Vascath) Non-tunneled catheter (Trialysis) used for acute dialysis Different lengths depending on site (see procedures section) Tunneled dialysis catheter (ex: Permcath) Typically used as a bridge to fistula/graft placement Placed by IR Peritoneal Dialysis Peritonitis Background Typically occurs due to contamination with pathogenic skin bacteria during exchanges or due to exit-site/tunnel infection Usually presents with cloudy effluent fluid and abdominal pain. Can also be asymptomatic Important history to obtain: recent contamination, accidental disconnection, endoscopic or gynecologic procedure, as well as the presence of constipation or diarrhea Definitive diagnosis requires 2 of the following: Clinical features consistent with peritonitis Positive dialysis effluent culture Dialysis effluent with WBC > 100 with PMN > 50% Even if WBC count \\< 100, presence of > 50% PMNs is still strong evidence of peritonitis in pts with rapid cycle PD Evaluation Examine catheter exit site Culture peritoneal fluid (requires specific technique, done by nephrology) Peritoneal cell count with diff, gram stain and culture Obtain peripheral blood cultures if there is concern for sepsis Management All PD orders, intraperitoneal antibiotics, and prescription adjustments should be directed by ESRD consult service (page them overnight if concerns) Treatment with intraperitoneal antibiotics should be started immediately after specimens have been obtained if there is high clinical suspicion Empiric antibiotics regimen should cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, typically with vancomycin and third generation Cephalosporin Systemic antibiotics are generally not necessary unless pts have systemic signs of sepsis Pts with relapsing, recurrent or repeat peritonitis will likely need catheter removal Secondary prevention Treatment with intraperitoneal OR IV antibiotics (for any infection requiring > 1 dose of antibiotics) requires prophylaxis for fungal peritonitis with either: Nystatin 400,000 to 500,000 units orally TID Fluconazole 200 mg every other day or 100 mg qdaily Dialysate should be drained the day of endoscopies or gynecological procedures Intravenous Fluids \u2013 Chandler Montgomery Indications for intravenous fluid Restoration or maintenance of tissue perfusion Correction of electrolyte abnormalities Nutritional supplementation in those without reliable enteric access Categorized into crystalloids and colloids Crystalloid = water + electrolytes Colloid = water + proteins/large molecules Terms Osmolarity: osmoles of solute per L of solution Tonicity: ability to induce movement of water across a membrane Buffer: anions such as lactate, acetate, gluconate which are metabolized to bicarbonate in vivo with the goal of sustaining normal plasma pH Crystalloids Isotonic fluids used for volume resuscitation After ~ 30 mins, redistribute such that only 25% remains w/in intravascular space Balanced solutions (ex: Lactated Ringer\u2019s, Plasma-Lyte)= have electrolytes concentrations similar to plasma NS may lead to renal vasoconstriction, AKI, hemodynamic instability, increased mortality SMART and SALT-ED: balanced solutions had lower rates of death, new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction compared to NS Situations where NS may be preferred: Cerebral edema/traumatic brain injury Hypovolemic hyponatremia Pre-existing hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (e.g. after vomiting or over diuresis) Notes on LR The small amount of K in LR (~4 mEq/L) is unlikely to significantly exacerbate hyperkalemia Lactate in LR is sodium lactate.

Step 5: Evaluate for secondary disorders Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis Background Na+ is the predominant cation in normal plasma. Cl- and HCO3- are the predominant anions. There are anions that are not directly measured (e.g. most binding globulins, immunoglobulins, clotting factors, and other proteins). These unmeasured anions are responsible for the normal anion gap of ~12 meq/L. When there are extra unmeasured anions within the plasma, the anion gap increases Differential GOLDMARK: Glycols, oxyproline (acetaminophen metabolite), L-lactate, D-lactate, methanol, ASA, renal failure/uremia, ketoacids Evaluate for secondary disorders Corrected bicarbonate Corrected H**C**O 3 = patient\u2019s H**C**O 3 + (patient\u2019s anion gap - 12) Corrected H**C**O 3 > 26, coexisting metabolic alkalosis, Corrected HCO3 \\<22 coexisting non-AG metabolic acidosis Osmolar Gap If there is an anion gap, it is worthwhile to always calculate an osmolar gap. You will be surprised the number of toxic ingestions you catch this way Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA) There are two places from which people can waste bicarbonate- the kidneys and the gut The urine anion-gap, which corresponds to unmeasured urinary NH4+ (primary means of renal acid excretion), can differentiate between the two Urine anion gap = Unmeasured cations (NH4+) \u2013 unmeasured anions = U\u00adNa + UK \u2013 UCl Positive value-> low NH4+-> renal losses RTA Carbonic anhydrase inhibition: acetazolamide, topiramate Adrenal insufficiency Normal saline infusion Ne- GUT -ive value->high NH4+->kidneys working appropriately-> GI losses Diarrhea Pancreatic fistula Ureterosigmoidostomy Caveat: Proximal RTA has a normal distal urine acidification and has a negative urine AG Managing Metabolic Acidosis Lactic acidosis is the most common cause of anion gap metabolic acidosis that we encounter In general, avoid use of bicarbonate to treat lactic acidosis Remember: H + + HCO3 - \\<-> H2CO3 \\<-> H2O + CO2. While administering bicarbonate will transiently improve pH, carbonic acid will eventually form and ultimately worsen acidemia In acute NAGMA, reasonable to give bicarbonate when bicarb \\<12 or pH \\<7.1-7.2 Pay close attention to other electrolyte levels, especially potassium as it shifts back into cells Metabolic Alkalosis Background Metabolic alkalosis occurs as a primary disorder or as compensation for respiratory acidosis. A thorough history and exam can usually clarify which of these two scenarios is occurring In order for metabolic alkalosis to occur, there has to be both an inciting phase (e.g. volume depletion) and a maintenance phase (e.g. hypochloremia or hypokalemia) Presentation Most symptoms of metabolic alkalosis (confusion, nausea, vomiting, tremors) occur as a result of other electrolyte abnormalities (hypocalcemia, hypokalemia) Serum pH of >7.55 is likely the threshold where symptoms will develop Causes Saline responsive (e.g. hypochloremia) True volume depletion NG suction/Nausea/vomiting Diuretic use Saline refractory Hypokalemia Milk-Alkali syndrome Mineralocorticoid excess states Bartters Syndrome Gitelman\u2019s Syndrome Treatment Saline Responsive/Hypochloremia If volume deplete, then normal saline is treatment of choice If alkalosis develops in setting of diuresis, then make sure replacing KCl and consider acetazolamide Saline refractory Hypokalemia- replenish potassium stores Hyperaldosteronism- covered in more detail in the endocrinology section Bartter syndrome and Gitelman syndrome - replace electrolytes and refer to nephrology Electrolytes Hypercalcemia \u2013 Rebecca Choudhry and Trevor Stevens Background Total serum Calcium >10.5 Most (99%) Ca+2 is anhydrous and stored in bone. The remaining 1% is 60% bound (mostly to albumin), and 40% ionized and able to exert a physiologic effect Remember, there is an inverse relationship between pH and Ca2+. As pH declines, serum Ca increases due to H+ binding to albumin and releasing Ca2+ Don\u2019t forget to correct calcium level if hypoalbuminemia (or check ionized calcium level), Corrected Ca2+ = ((Normal albumin \u2013 Patient\u2019s albumin) x 0.8)) + Patient\u2019s Ca2+ This equation Is less reliable at very low albumin Presentation Ca+2 > 12 can cause shortened QT interval, 2 nd and 3 rd degree heart block, ventricular arrhythmias, and ST elevations mimicking MI Severe manifestations uncommon at Ca+2 \\<14 \u201cStones, bones, thrones, belly groans, and psychiatric overtones\u201d Bone pain Polydipsia/polyuria- due to nephrogenic DI Nausea/constipation Depressed mood/cognitive impairment Decreased level of consciousness Evaluation Measure PTH Normal or \u2191 PTH Primary hyperparathyroidism: \u2191 Ca+2 and \u2193 PO4-3 Tertiary hyperparathyroidism (autologous secretion of PTH in CKD/ESRD) Familial hypercalciuric hypercalcemia (often asymptomatic, no treatment required). Li toxicity \u2193 PTH Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (PTHrP) Malignancy (boney metastases) Excess vitamin D intake Granulomatous disease: 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D, 25 hydroxyvitamin D, or ACE level Milk-alkali syndrome Medications (classically HCTZ) Thyrotoxicosis Adrenal insufficiency Management If Ca+2 \\< 12 and asymptomatic Encourage PO hydration Normal saline if hypovolemic Evaluate for underlying cause If Ca+2 > 12 with symptoms or Ca > 14 Trend Ca q8 hrs, EKG, monitor on telemetry; strict I/Os \u00b1 foley catheter Volume expansion w/ NS bolus followed by continuous infusion at ~ 200cc/hr Goal UOP 100-150cc/hr Add loop diuretic (Lasix) once patient is volume expanded Bisphosphonates Zoledronic acid 4mg IV (EGFR >60), Pamidronate 90mg IV (EGFR 15-60) If Ca+2 >14 or neurologic symptoms, consider subq (not intranasal) calcitonin VUMC: requires approval from an oncology or endocrine attending Tachyphylaxis after ~48H Additional Information In CHF pt, consider early addition of a loop diuretic, especially if volume overloaded In ESRD pt with hypercalcemia (rare), patient with oliguric AKI not responsive to IVF, or pt with severely elevated Ca 16-18, consult endocrine and nephrology early In pts with sarcoidosis or lymphoma, consider glucocorticoids Hypocalcemia \u2013 Trey Richardson Background Can be divided into low parathyroid hormone and high parathyroid hormone states Low PTH Magnesium deficiency Post-operative for parathyroidectomy DiGeorge syndrome Medications: Bisphosphonates, denosumab, aminoglycosides, gadolinium Acidemia (Serum Ca is inversely proportional to pH) Infiltrative disease: sarcoid, hemochromatosis, malignancies Autoimmune hypoparathyroidism CRRT (if using regional citrate anticoagulation) High PTH Late-stage CKD Hyperphosphatemia Vitamin D deficiency Pseudohypoparathyroidism/Parathyroid resistance Consumption/deposition: Pancreatitis, rhabdomyolysis, some osteoblastic metastases Sepsis or critical illness Presentation Chvostek and Trousseau\u2019s signs , laryngospasm, seizures, widened QRS and arrhythmias Hemodynamic instability Evaluation Check PTH, albumin, iCal, VBG, Vitamin D Review medications for possible offenders Management Under most circumstances there is no need to replace calcium. Instead, focus on correcting the underlying perturbation (e.g. acidemia, hypomagnesemia, treating pancreatitis, etc. ) If hemodynamic instability, cardiac electrical instability, seizures then aggressive intravenous replacement is warranted. Also consider preemptive repletion for patients requiring high-volume of blood transfusions (citrate in blood products can cause hypocalcemia) 1 g of CaCl is equivalent to 3 grams of Ca Gluconate Avoid treatment in hyperphosphatemia, advanced CKD/ESRD, and rhabdomyolysis Hypernatremia \u2013 Lauren Chan Overview of dysnatremias Fluctuations in serum Na reflect fluctuations in plasma free water Sodium is the major driver of tonicity. The clinical signs and symptoms of serum Na fluctuations are related to changes in tonicity with most profound effects on cerebral tissue Two major mechanisms maintain plasma osmolarity between 275 and 290: Thirst and secretion of ADH. When these mechanisms malfunction, dysnatremias occur Background Definition: Na+ >145 Hypernatremia = decreased free water Almost always due to inadequate free water intake (ICU patients, dementia, limited mobility, tube feeding/TPN, impaired thirst/adipsia from hypothalamic stroke). Hospital acquired hypernatremia is iatrogenic and correlates with poor outcomes Can also occur from: Na+ overload (salt poisoning, iatrogenic from NS infusion, over correction), osmotic diuresis (hyperglycemia, SGLT-2 inhibitors, urea, mannitol), diabetes insipidus Presentation Lethargy, irritability, confusion Seizures, coma, hemorrhagic stroke, or subarachnoid hemorrhage (from the effects of hypertonic serum on cerebral vasculature) Evaluation Step 1: Treat underlying cause (vomiting, hyperglycemia, medications) Step 2: Determine volume status: If severely hypovolemic, the patient will need IV crystalloid to restore volume in addition to free water Step 3: Estimate and replace free water deficit (FWD): FWD = TBW x [(serum Na/140) - 1] Step 4: Account for ongoing insensible losses and electrolyte free water clearance Rule of thumb for accounting for electrolyte free water clearance. This is in addition to replacing free water deficit 0-1 Liter of urine output: Ignore, no need to replace 1-3 Liters of urine output: Replace half of the losses >3 liters of urine output: Replace all urine losses No evidence that overcorrecting hypernatremia is harmful. In fact, there is increased mortality with overly cautious correction or under correction If able, replace free water enterally. Otherwise, administer D5W intravenously Additional Information Pts w/ suspected DI: Consult Nephrology (may require desmopressin or may receive desmopressin once stabilized to differentiate between central and nephrogenic DI) Pts with hypokalemia: giving K decreases total amount of free water you are giving the pt Hyponatremia \u2013 Lauren Chan Background Definition: Mild: Na+ 130-134 Moderate: Na+ 125-129 Severe: Na+ \\<125 Hyponatremia occurs when free water reabsorption (i.e. ADH is on) or intake exceeds free water excretion Presentation Mild to moderate symptoms: lethargy, N/V, dizziness, confusion, fatigue, cramping Severe symptoms: obtundation, coma, respiratory arrest, seizure Evaluation and Management Step 1: Serum osm >295: Hyper-osmolar, presence of other molecules that contribute to serum osmolarity Glucose, mannitol, iodinated contrast If hyperglycemic, corrected serum Na+ = measured Na+ + 1.6*[(glucose \u2013 100)/100] If corrected Na+ is normal, treat hyperglycemia; not a water balance problem If corrected Na+ is low, there is hypotonic hyponatremia + coexisting hyperglycemia Renal failure (urea) and ethanol: Ineffective osmoles that can freely diffuse across cells and do NOT lead to hyponatremia 275-295: Iso-osmolar Pseudohyponatremia 2/2 hypertriglyceridemia, paraproteinemia, or lipoprotein X: Serum Na not actually low, due to how the lab is calculated \\<275: Hypo-osmolar \u00e0 Step 2 Step 2: Urine Osm Surrogate for ADH activity Uosm \\<100 or Uosm \\< Sosm correlates with low ADH Primary polydipsia: Free water intake>output Tea and toast: Lack solute to effectively concentrate urine Beer drinkers\u2019 potomania: Mixture of the two above Uosm >100 or Uosm > Sosm correlates with high ADH Step 3 Step 3: Urine Na Is ADH on in the setting of decreased effective arterial bloodvolume (EABV) or decreased mean arterial pressure (i.e. appropriate ADH)?

High uric acid suggests some degree of volume depletion and appropriate ADH activity. Rate of correction Acute (\\<48 hrs) If symptomatic, give 150 cc bolus 3% NaCl up to two times. Monitor Na+ q1-2 hr Goal is an initial rapid 4-6 mEq/L correction and then hold May require Hypertonic Saline infusion with DDAVP clamp if at risk of over-correcting Chronic (>48 hrs or unknown, higher risk for osmotic demyelination if corrected too quickly): Goal Na+ correction rate 4-6 mEq/L over 24 hrs (Max 8mEq/L) When to call Nephrology If you are worried about rapid over-correction: High risk patients are those with rapidly reversible causes Low solute states (Beer drinker\u2019s potomania, psychogenic polydipsia, tea-toast)- as soon as they decrease their excess free water intake, they will rapidly clear free water Volume depletion- as volume is replaced and the stimulus for ADH release is switched off, then they will rapidly clear the excess free water if they have normal underlying kidney function High risk for ODS includes: chronic liver disease, Na \\<105 meq/dL, alcoholism, and malnutrition. Consideration of DDAVP clamp Hyperkalemia \u2013 Mengyao Tang and Amanda Morrison Background Causes: Cellular shifts: Acidemia, Rhabdomyolysis, TLS, beta blockade Aldosterone deficient states: T4 RTA, Primary adrenal insufficiency Decreased distal tubular delivery: Volume depletion Decreased clearance: AKI, CKD, ESRD Excessive intake Medication-related: ACEi, ARB, MRA, NSAIDs, TMP/SMX, digoxin, heparin Pseudo-Hyperkalemia: hemolysis, severe leukocytosis Symptoms are rare, but usually manifest as cardiac dysrhythmias Evaluation Confirm hyperkalemia with repeat BMP Check EKG for hyperkalemic changes (sensitivity for EKG findings in hyper K is poor) K+ 5.5-6.5: peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval K+ 6.5-8: prolonged QRS, loss of P wave, ST elevation, ectopic beats K+ >8: sine wave pattern, asystole, PEA, VF Management If EKG changes or signs of instability Calcium gluconate 1g IV (effective within 3-5 min) Stabilizes cardiac membrane for ~60mins SHOULD BE REPEATED HOURLY while hyperkalemic Shift K+ (temporizing measures) D50 w/ regular insulin 10 units (can order using Adult Hyperkalemia order set in epic) Use 5 units if there is renal impairment Lasts for 4-6hrs (can be longer in renal impairment) Correct acidosis- Consider using isotonic bicarb Beta Agonists (e.g. high-dose albuterol nebulizer); lasts 2-4 hrs Note that typical albuterol nebulizer is 2.5mg, need 10-20mg to have an effect Increase K+ Excretion Loop diuretic- if the kidneys work, use them If there is AKI or a volume deficit can administer with IVF Volume expansion with IVF: Increases distal Na delivery and K excretion. NS and LR are likely equally effective. GI cation exchangers Kayexalate (Polystyrene sulfonate)- only effective if having BMs. 60g PO q2h until bowel movement (If using oral, ensure patient is having bowel movements and is not obstructed, could cause bowel injury/ necrosis). PO can take up to 6hrs to work. Consider per rectal administration for faster action but DO NOT GIVE WITH SORBITOL per rectum Lokelma (Sodium-zirconium-cyclosilicate) 10 g PO TID for 48 H. Actively exchanges K for other cations within the small bowel and works within 2 hours. Remember to stop once the K is normal since can cause hypokalemia. Also keep in mind the high Na content of Lokelma (400mg/5g dose of lokelma) Needs approval from nephrology Hemodialysis: Consult nephrology early if severe hyper K+ Hypokalemia \u2013 Peter Thorne and Patrick Steadman Background Potassium (K+) \\< 3.5 mEq/L 98% of total body K+ is intracellular (majority in muscle cells) Goal: prevent life threatening complication (e.g. arrhythmia), replace deficit, elucidate cause Insulin and catecholamines (Beta adrenoreceptors) are key drivers of transcellular shifts H+ and K+ will trade places to maintain electroneutrality Presentation Malaise, weakness, myalgias, decreased gastrointestinal motility EKG changes: Mild: ST segment depression, decreased T wave amplitude Severe: U-waves (most commonly seen in precordial leads V2 and V3) Severe hypokalemia can lead to rhabdomyolysis Evaluation History: decreased K+ intake, increased entry into cells (ex: elevated beta-adrenergic activity, hypothermia), GI losses, urinary losses (diuretics, hypomagnesemia, RTA, tubular defects, hyperaldosteronism) If concomitant metabolic alkalosis: Normal/low BP suggests diuretic use, vomiting or Gitelman/Bartter syndromes Hypertension suggests renovascular disease or primary mineralocorticoid excess Labs: BMP, CBC, VBG, urine electrolytes, magnesium, POC glucose, CK.

Prefer Renal and Bladder Ultrasound in pregnant patients All pts w/gross hematuria that is non-glomerular in source, in whom infection has been ruled out, warrant cystoscopy. Additionally, all patients with clots need cystoscopy Kidney Transplant Medicine \u2013 Trey Richardson Introduction The goal of this section is to serve as a guide for tackling the most common transplant complications as well as offer a few tips for managing immunosuppression while kidney transplant patients are admitted to the hospital Alphabet soup PRA: panel reactive antibodies DSA: donor specific antibodies CMV (-/+): indicates the CMV status of both the recipient and the donor FK506 or FK: another name for tacrolimus KDPI: Kidney donor profile index used to \u201cgrade\u201d the quality of the donated organ X/6 MM: indicates the number of HLA subtypes that are mismatched between donor and recipient Infections in Kidney Transplant Recipients Background Infections in a kidney transplant recipient can be divided into 3 phases: \\<1-month post-transplant Surgical site infections, nosocomial infections (e.g. C. Diff, CAUTIs, and CLABSIs), and donor-derived infections/reactivation of latent recipient infections predominate 1-6 months post-transplant Depleted immune-system regenerates increased risk for disseminated fungal (e.g. PJP, histo/blasto) and viral infections (HSV, adenovirus) >6 months post-transplant Risk for atypical infections persists, but common community acquired syndromes should still be on the differential This section will focus on the most common infection in kidney transplant recipients- infections of the urinary tract Evaluation UA with culture Examine the native kidneys (CVA tenderness) AND the allograft (almost always in RLQ, denervated so the graft itself will not be tender, but the surrounding soft-tissue may) Renal U/S (of both allograft and native kidneys) or CT AP if: Early post-op (1 month) Recurrent (2+ episodes in year) History of nephrolithiasis or if sepsis/bacteremia Blood cultures if systemic signs/symptoms Consider testing for C. urealyticum, and sending fungal and AFB urine cultures if UA is recurrently positive but culture negative Management Remove or replace indwelling catheters Review prior culture susceptibilities (if available) Empiric antibiotic regimens: Asymptomatic bacteriuria: treat with FQ or beta lactam for 5-7 days if \\<3 mos post-transplant Simple cystitis: Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin 250 BID or Levaquin 500 mg daily), Augmentin (500 mg BID), 3 rd gen cephalosporin (cefpodoxime 100 mg BID or cefixime 400 mg daily) or nitrofurantoin 100 mg BID (if GFR>30, only treats cystitis since drug only concentrates in the urine) \\< 6 mos post-transplant: treat for 10-14 days >6 mos post-transplant: treat for 5-7 days Complicated UTI/Pyelonephritis (cover Pseudomonas, gram negatives and Enterococcus): Ceftriaxone 2g daily (preferred), Cefepime 2g q8hrs (add Vancomycin when using cephalosporin if suspicious for enterococcus) or Pip-tazo 3.75g q6hrs, can also use meropenem 1g q8h (need ID approval) Treat for 14-21 days For stable pts with mild complicated UTI, can consider giving more narrow empiric antibiotics: Augmentin 875 mg BID or ciprofloxacin 500 mg q12h MDR UTI: Consult transplant ID Options: meropenem-vaborbactam, ceftolozone-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam In pts w/PCKD, include lipophilic antibiotic (such as ciprofloxacin) to penetrate cysts Prevention Bactrim used for PJP prophylaxis during first 6 mos post-transplant also prevents UTIs Basic infection prevention measures for all comers (e.g. hydration, frequent voiding, wiping front to back, voiding after sexual intercourse) Acute Kidney Injury of Kidney Transplant Background Most patients admitted to medicine services with kidney transplants are >3 months post-op. Therefore, we are typically not managing perioperative complications such as delayed graft function, or hyper-acute rejection. Below are the most common causes of acute kidney injury in kidney transplant recipients. Evaluation Signs and symptoms of UTI? Assess volume status Review meds for recent medication changes Common offenders: NSAIDs, ACE, diuretics, azole antifungals Medication non-adherence Tacrolimus (FK) or cyclosporine (CsA) level FK levels increase with n/v, diarrhea due to alterations in p-glycoprotein expression within inflamed GI tract FK toxicity also causes diarrhea and volume depletion Proteinuria: Transplant patients with 1 g/day proteinuria usually get biopsies Review donor characteristics (CMV status, PRA, % HLA antibodies present, DSAs) BK PCR: consider only if unclear source of AKI and no recent titers Serum PCR is test of choice Renal transplant U/S (costly and not always warranted) \\< 1 week post-transplant: If acute graft dysfunction, look for thrombosis, urine/ureter leak > 1 week post-transplant: Cr does not respond to 48 hours of current management Lack of clear, reversible causes Hydronephrosis (can occur after stent removal 4-6 wks after transplant or due to perinephric fluid collection) Arterial stenosis (\u2191 velocities in renal artery -- very concerning when velocity >300), tardus parvus waveforms) Perinephric abscess with recurrent UTI/pyelonephritis Urinoma (usually first 2-3 weeks), hematoma (after a biopsy) Unique findings: Resistive indices: reflect central renal vascular compliance. High indices in transplant patients signify parenchymal problem (rejection, infection, ATN) Biopsy To differentiate ATN vs rejection vs BK nephropathy vs recurrent disease (FSGS, lupus, etc.) Post Biopsy Care: Watch for bleeding and HTN Blood can get into collecting system, then the capsule, and into the perinephric space causing Page Kidney (aka Pressure Tamponade) Compressed renal vessels-> RAAS surge --> rapid, severe HTN (STAT page the renal fellow) Kidney Transplant Rejection Background Rejection is divided into acute vs chronic and T-cell mediated or antibody mediated Pathologists can determine the type of rejection and the chronicity by observing the structures that are acutely involved (e.g. tubulitis, glomerulitis, arteritis, and capillaritis) as well as the time course of involvement (e.g. presence of fibrosis) Structures exhibiting fibrosis represent chronic rejection that is unlikely to respond to treatment, whereas acute inflammation may be amenable to acute therapies This section will focus on acute rejection since this is the clinical entity we will most likely manage while on the wards Acute Rejection Acute T cell mediated rejection Infiltration of the graft by lymphocytes and inflammatory cells characterized by tubulitis, interstitial inflammation, and arteritis (on occasion) Treatment: High dose glucocorticoids (methyl prednisolone) is first line (~ 5 days) Thymoglobulin (polyclonal Ig anti-T cell) Use depends on severity of rejection Indicated if Cr fails to improve after steroids T cell subsets are measured during treatment until depleted Tacro target levels are reset to ~8-10 if treated for acute T cell mediated rejection Acute antibody mediated rejection (ABMR) Donor specific antibody mediated rejection characterized by glomerulitis, peri-tubular capillaritis (microcirculation inflammation), complement deposition (C4d staining), and presence of DSA Treatment = B-cell depletion therapy IV methyl prednisone 500 mg IV x 3-5 days Plasmapheresis (If with high titers of DSA) IVIG 2 g/kg (max 140 g) Rituximab 375 mg/m2 Kidney Transplant Immunosuppression Background Most patients with kidney transplants are on triple therapy with an anti-metabolite (azathioprine or mycophenolate compound) or mTOR inhibitor + calcineurin inhibitor + prednisone You may also come across patients who are on monthly infusions with belatacept, a selective T-cell co-stimulation blocker Calcineurin inhibitors Tacrolimus (FK), cyclosporine (CsA) Envarsus XR is a once a day long acting formulation of tacrolimus Common side-effects Worsening kidney function: mediated by vasoconstriction to the afferent arterioles Hypertension- treat with CCBs Diabetes Hand tremors, headache, nausea Thrombotic microangiopathy T4 RTA- hyperkalemia Gingival hyperplasia mTOR Inhibitors Sirolimus, everolimus Major side effects: Poor wound healing, rarely pneumonitis Anti-metabolites Azathioprine Mycophenolate preparations: Mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept, MMF), Mycophenolic acid (Myfortic) Side effects: Bone marrow suppression- hold for lymphopenia; GI upset- hold for diarrhea Additional Information for Overnight Admits: Do not change immunosuppression Exception: If pt has severe diarrhea, can hold night tacro dose and inform the day team Daily tacrolimus or cyclosporine level (order qam at 5:00). Always order tacrolimus or cyclosporine dose at 6:00 am and 6:00 pm (regardless of what time patient takes at home, lab can only run am tacro levels at a certain time in batches) EXCEPTION: If late afternoon admission, consider paging the fellow (since its early) and ask if they want the evening dose held until the am level comes back Transplant patients with normal kidney function can have regular diet","title":"Main"},{"location":"nephrology/nephrology-acute-rejection/","text":"Acute Rejection \u00b6 Acute Rejection T cell mediated (Cellular Rejection) Infiltration of the graft by lymphocytes and inflammatory cells Treatment: high dose steroids (methyl pred) is first line (~ 5 days +) Thymoglobulin (polyclonal Ig anti-T cell) Use depends on severity of rejection Indicated if Cr fails to improve after steroids T cell subsets are measured before and during treatment until depleted Tacro target levels are reset to ~8 if treated for acute T cell mediated rejection Antibody Mediated Rejection (ABMR) Acute tissue injury with circulating donor-specific antibodies (DSAs); requires evidence of antibody-mediated damage Ig\u2019s deposit and activate complement: key is C4d staining in the graft will be strongly positive Treatment: IV methyl prednisone (3-5 days) Plasmapheresis + IVIG Followed often by Rituxan before d/c","title":"Acute Rejection"},{"location":"nephrology/nephrology-acute-rejection/#acute-rejection","text":"Acute Rejection T cell mediated (Cellular Rejection) Infiltration of the graft by lymphocytes and inflammatory cells Treatment: high dose steroids (methyl pred) is first line (~ 5 days +) Thymoglobulin (polyclonal Ig anti-T cell) Use depends on severity of rejection Indicated if Cr fails to improve after steroids T cell subsets are measured before and during treatment until depleted Tacro target levels are reset to ~8 if treated for acute T cell mediated rejection Antibody Mediated Rejection (ABMR) Acute tissue injury with circulating donor-specific antibodies (DSAs); requires evidence of antibody-mediated damage Ig\u2019s deposit and activate complement: key is C4d staining in the graft will be strongly positive Treatment: IV methyl prednisone (3-5 days) Plasmapheresis + IVIG Followed often by Rituxan before d/c","title":"Acute Rejection"},{"location":"nephrology/nephrology-aki/","text":"AKI \u00b6 Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) \u2013 Joseph Quintana, Mengyao Tang Background Rise in Creatinine (Cr) > 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours, or increase > 1.5 x baseline in 7 days Oliguria = \\< 0.3 mL/kg/hr or \\< 500 mL/day Anuria = \\< 50 mL/day ACE -i\u2019s and ARB\u2019s alter the renal autoregulation and exacerbate pre-renal AKI Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) and pre-renal disease comprise 66% of inpatient AKI Pre- renal: Fluid losses: GI, blood, Respiratory or metabolic losses [fevers, tachypnea, sepsis] Decreased effective intravascular volume [HFrEF, Hepatorenal] Afferent arteriole constriction [NSAIDs, Iodinated contrast] Intra-renal (Tubular and interstitial disease) : ATN = Most common ; Ischemia or nephrotoxin ACE-i + NSAIDs, ACE-i + contrast, prerenal + ACE-i, prerenal + NSAIDs Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) usually drug-induced Other causes : Crystalline nephropathy: IV acyclovir, tumor lysis Small vessel disease: MAHA, TTP, HUS Large vessel problems: Aortic dissection, renal artery stenosis Glomerular disease: Nephritic pattern Post-renal (Obstruction): Ureteral: obstructing stones (B/L or one with single kidney), external compression Bladder: neurogenic bladder, malignancy, obstructing blood clot Urethra: BPH Misplaced Foley catheter Evaluation Urinalysis , Strict I/O\u2019s Fluid challenge: Improve w/ diuresis \uf0e0 CHF Improve w/ resuscitation \uf0e0 hypovolemia Protein /Cr urine spot ratio : quantify tubular vs glomerular range proteinuria Post Void R esidual bladder scan, great test, low cost, high reward Elevated PVRs = 250 cc plus Who needs imaging (Renal U/S)?

Start with benzos: 2 mg lorazepam IV then repeat q1-3 minutes up to 0.1 mg/kg OR 5 mg of diazepam IV every minute (takes longer to give diazepam so would give concurrent ASM) 10 mg IM midazolam if no IV access After 2 rounds of benzos, would shift to antiepileptics if still in status (neurology should be contacted here if not already): IV fosphenytoin 20 mg/kg IV levetiracetam 30-60 mg/kg (generally 3g, up to 4.5g max) IV valproic acid 30 mg/kg If still seizing at this point, the patient will likely need intubation These pts MUST be placed on EEG if they get paralyzed or sedated because convulsive status often continues as nonconvulsive status, which still damages the brain! If still seizing, patients should be on midazolam, propofol or barbiturate infusions Focal seizures, such as arm or face twitching with retained awareness do not always need to be treated to the point of initiating coma Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) Background Disorders of the neuromuscular junction MG affects the post-synaptic cleft at the acetylcholine receptor LEMS affects the pre-synaptic cleft at the calcium channels Many cases are paraneoplastic (classically small cell lung carcinoma) Presentation Double vision, ptosis, dysarthria, dysphagia Dyspnea looks different than in other conditions: air hunger, usually also with dysphagia Initially, the patient may not look sick or distressed, but may have a short inspiratory time or difficulty speaking in complete sentences due to shallow breathing Most pts have a known history of myasthenia, but up to 20% present initially with crisis Evaluation Exam Look closely for ptosis, nasal speech, weak neck flexion/extension (same nerve roots as diaphragm), interrupted speech to take extra breaths These patients do not exhibit \u201chuffing and puffing\u201d like in COPD/asthma exacerbations Patients with NMJ disease can go from talking to intubated within several hours! LEMS: less ocular weakness, but do have extremity weakness and absent reflexes. Pulmonary compromise is very rare in LEMS EMG/NCS MG: decremental response to repetitive stimulation LEMS: increased amplitude in response to repetitive stimulation Labs Myasthenia antibody panels (send prior to IVIG/PLEX being given) Imaging Consider chest CT to look for thymic hyperplasia Management Monitor NIF (negative inspiratory force) at baseline and q4h Measure of diaphragmatic strength Normal is \\<-60 If below -30, consider elective intubation Note that patient effort will affect NIF values IVIG or PLEX Both have similar supportive evidence; IVIG is usually easier to do PLEX has the risks you would expect with dialysis (e.g. fluid shifts) and coagulopathy IVIG -> check IgA levels. Can increase risk of DVT, has risk of aseptic meningitis and provides significant fluid load so not ideal for pts with CHF Steroids Usually up-titrated SLOWLY (by 10-20 mg prednisone daily) Rapid increases in steroids can worsen patients with MG**, so talk to neuro before adjusting** Pyridostigmine Typically continue at their home dose Too much pyridostigmine can make patients worse (more secretions), so for those doing poorly on >90 mg per dose, consider lowering the dose Treat underlying causes of exacerbations: usually infections or other toxic/metabolic insults Remove/avoid exacerbating medications: fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, beta blockers, and magnesium LEMS specific management: 3,4-diaminopyridine Can respond to IVIG or pyridostigmine Workup for underlying neoplasm Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (AIDP) Background Rapid onset polyneuropathy that manifests most often with ascending weakness and numbness that can involve the respiratory and facial musculature Usually preceded by infectious illness a few weeks prior Patients are much more likely to get AIDP from an infection than any vaccine, weak vaccine links to AIDP are an addition 1-2 cases per million flu vaccines. Presentation Acute, progressive extremity weakness, weak or absent reflexes, and potentially subjective sensatory changes, especially back pain There are a TON of variants of AIDP, with some having cranial nerve weakness early, proximal weakness, sensory ataxia, primarily sensory loss, or rapid muscle weakness; do not use lack of classic ascending weakness to dismiss the idea of AIDP Sensory loss is common in an ascending pattern too Evaluation LP \u2013 albuminocytologic dissociation = high protein with normal cell count One exception is HIV, which can cause AIDP but also have a high cell count and high protein count EMG/NCS Demyelinating pattern (temporal dispersion and decreased conduction velocities).

Can trial B6 supplementation to help with mood effects Valproic acid (Depakote) (PO/IV) Sedation, hirsutism, PCOS, P450 inhibitor, nausea, liver injury, hyperammonemia Phenytoin (Dilantin) (PO/Fosphenytoin IV) Sedation, gingival hyperplasia Lacosamide (Vimpat) (PO/IV) Heart block, dizziness, ataxia Topiramate (Topamax) (PO) Kidney stones, metabolic acidosis, paresthesias, weight loss, cognitive slowing Carbamazepine (Tegretol) (PO) Hyponatremia, SJS (in Han Chinese check HLA), bone marrow suppression (rare) Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) (PO) Similar to carbamazepine Lamotrigine (Lamictal) (PO) SJS/TEN, nausea. Least sedating Zonisamide (Zonegran) (PO) Sedation, ataxia, nausea, confusion Non-Epileptic Spells (aka PNES, psychogenic non-epileptic spells) Can be very difficult to distinguish from epileptic seizures Features more common in PNES Retained awareness with bilateral extremity \u201cseizing\u201d Opisthotonus (arching the back) Talking during a spell Excessively long spells (e.g. lasts hour or days) Forced eye closure Coachability during a spell or reacting to external stimuli Heavy breathing during a spell with lots of rigorous movement Immediately returning to normal after a spell Features more common in epileptic seizures: Seizures arising out of sleep Highly stereotyped Incontinence Severe injuries (e.g. burns) Management Try to avoid excessive BZD use This requires good clinical judgement as you wouldn't want to withhold Ativan and discover that the pt was having true atypical seizures. The compromise would be: do not repeatedly administer BZDs when there is suspicion for PNES as well as no evidence of response to prior BZD administration. Syncopal Convulsions Very common, can present with posturing and tonic-clonic movements happening for a few moments after syncope Should not last for more than 30 seconds These are just related to syncope and do not typically require seizure medications Workup: Two-hour EEG and MRI (with and without contrast) Infectious workup, BMP, CBC, blood glucose, toxicology/drug screen If there is concern for convulsive syncope, (carefully) check orthostatic vitals Inpatient Headache (HA) Background Important to distinguish primary and secondary headache Red flags for secondary headaches (SNOOPP): Systemic symptoms, Neurologic symptoms, Onset that is sudden (thunderclap), Older age (new headache >40), Progression or evolution in previous headaches, Postural component Other red flags: preceding trauma, headache awakening patient from sleep, no headache-free intervals, thunderclap headache (maximal intensity develops within 11 minutes or less) Evaluation Get a good description of where the pain is, when, associated symptoms, and assess for \u201cred flag\u201d features listed above If there are any red flag features imaging and workup are necessary Imaging depends on highest suspicions, but CTA head/neck is appropriate to evaluate for aneurysm (including neck to consider dissection). If any focal signs, MRI is generally preferred; venous imaging can be beneficial in headaches with features of elevated ICP If no red flag features, then workup is not necessary, and focus is on treatment Management NSAIDs and Tylenol for infrequent headaches, but consistent use (>2-3 a week) runs the risk of rebound headaches Triptans for migraine, but contraindicated in patients with CAD, uncontrolled HTN, previous stroke. They must be used within 6 hour of onset There are theoretical concerns of serotonin syndrome when used with SSRI/SNRIs Migraines: \u201cMigraine cocktail\u201d: 1L fluid bolus, 4g Mg, IV Compazine(10mg) OR Phenergan(20mg) with Benadryl (25mg) 2 nd line: Depakote 1000 mg IV, decadron 10mg IV , \u00b1 toradol 30mg IV, flexeril 10mg PO Cluster headache: Triptans, high flow O2 (>10 L), sometimes intranasal lidocaine if no arrhythmia history Outpatient Headache Type Presentation First line meds Tension type (most common) Generally bilateral, pressure/tightness, mild/moderate pain, no significant photophobia, phonophobia, or nausea Acetaminophen, TCAs, SNRIs Migraine Unilateral, pulsating, moderate-to-severe pain, lasts 4-72hr, worse with activity and improves with sleep Associated with nausea, photophobia or phonophobia \u00b1 Aura Acute: triptans Preventive: TCAs, propranolol, topiramate, VPA Cluster Severe, often extreme unilateral orbital/supra-orbital/temporal pain, often with lacrimation, rhinorrhea, sweating, swelling of face, visual changes Acute: 100% FiO2 at 12L/min for at least 15 mins, triptans, Indomethacin Medication Overuse HA at least \u00bd the days of the month, w/medication intake at least \u00bd the days of the month; often presents as worsening HA despite increased intake of medication. Often seen with meds that include caffeine (Excedrin, fioricet) \\*STOP offending medication, typically via taper. HA will worsen before it gets better, start concurrent daily prophylactic headache medication Medication Overview: Abortive Triptans (e.g. sumatriptan or rizatriptan) Cannot be used more than 10 days/month Avoid in pts with hypertension/CAD Preventative Amitriptyline: indicated for both migraine and tension-type. Helps with sleep and comorbid depression. Most common side effects (SE) = dry mouth, sedation Topiramate: has the best evidence among migraine meds. Can theoretically help with weight loss. Most common SE = sodas taste bad, sedation, parasthesias Propranolol: useful for relative lack of interactions. Mild cardiac/blood pressure effects compared to other beta-blockers. Most common SE = drowsiness Magnesium oxide: reduces headache frequency with almost no SE. Start 400mg daily, can go up to 800mg BID. Patients can increase dose until they get diarrhea. Riboflavin (vitamin B2): mild effect but effectively has no side effects. 400mg daily. Gabapentin: can be useful if HAs have stabbing/electric quality. Main SE = sedation Venlafaxine: useful for migraines with significant vestibular symptoms (dizziness). SE = hypertension/tachycardia. Verapamil: can be used for migraine and cluster headaches. Can use ER formulation Botox: can be administered every 3 months. Can be very effective, but pts generally will have had to fail multiple medications for insurance to approve refer to neuro resident clinic CGRP receptor modulators (mostly injections) such as Rimegepant are newer options Parkinson\u2019s Disease Clinical Presentation Resting tremor is typically a very early symptom, often worse on one side Cogwheel rigidity; can be confused for paratonia, which is seen in demented or encephalopathic patients who have involuntary variable resistance movements during passive ROM assessment Speech changes (low volume), hand-writing changes (slow small movements) Gait changes Festination \u2013 slow start with movements that gradually build up speed En bloc turning \u2013 taking multiple steps to turn around Anosmia and REM behavior sleep disorders are very common Evaluation Clinical diagnosis; there are some supportive imaging studies like DaTscan that looks for activity of substantia nigra (usually not necessary) Clinical response to dopamine replacement is so typical that if a patient does not respond, it is important to consider a Parkinson plus syndrome (see below) Management Dopamine replacement \u2013 carbidopa/levodopa; dosed at regular intervals several times a day. These generally do not need to be held on admission. If pt is altered, can hold anticholinergics, MAO-B inhibitors or COMT inhibitors Dopamine agonists \u2013 can cause confusion, hallucinations, dyskinesias MAO-B inhibitors (MAOIs): can cause confusion, hallucinations, insomnia and dyskinesias COMT inhibitors \u2013 can cause confusion, hallucinations, insomnia, and dyskinesias Anticholinergics \u2013 useful for tremor when there is not much bradykinesia or gait disturbances. In older pts cognitive changes are a bigger concern along with hallucinations PD medications are rarely titrated in the hospital because acute medical illness makes PD symptoms worse and everything will need to be re-adjusted as an outpatient Be cautious with PRN anti-emetics in patients with PD. Many work via dopamine antagonism. Zofran is generally the safest option. Similarly, many antipsychotics have dopamine antagonism. Safest option is seroquel Parkinson Plus Syndromes Evaluation Consider if atypical features such as bilateral symmetric onset, early cognitive/personality changes, cerebellar findings, or prominent autonomic dysfunction early Types Progressive Supranuclear Palsy PD symptoms with early falls and minimal tremor Vertical eye movement abnormalities Multisystem Atrophy Profound orthostatic hypotension without any increase in HR Three types: MSA-A \u2013 autonomic features prominent (previously Shy-Drager Syndrome) MSA-P \u2013 prominent atypical Parkinsonism features MSA-C \u2013 prominent cerebellar dysfunction Lewy Body Dementia Parkinsonism with prominent early cognitive impairment and hallucinations Brain Masses Background Neoplasm is the biggest concern 90% of malignant brain masses are metastatic Most commonly: lung, RCC, breast, melanoma Highest bleeding risk: melanoma, thyroid, choriocarcinoma, RCC Primary brain tumors Gliomas: WHO Grade I-IV Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) \u2013 WHO Grade IV; large heterogenous masses with edema; heterogenous contrast enhancement; can cross the corpus callosum Lower grade gliomas \u2013 include oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas Meningioma: usually low grade Can be left alone and monitored with yearly MRI If symptomatic, may need resection/radiation Ependymoma: uncommon. Can cause CSF outflow obstruction CNS lymphoma \u2013 diffuse WM involvement, with mass effect, restricts diffusion on MRI with prominent contrast enhancement. Can also cross the corpus callosum Usually B-cell, initially responds significantly to steroids Presentation A significant number of brain lesions are detected incidentally If a patient has a first-time seizure, brain mass needs to be ruled out HA (usually constant, severe), seizure, and focal neurologic deficits Evaluation/Management Imaging: MRI w/ and w/o contrast provides the most information Findings suggesting malignant lesions: marked edema, multifocal lesions, or presence at gray-white junctions LP may be indicated if herniation risk is low, particularly if concerned for infection Biopsy will ultimately be needed in most cases, which is done by NSGY Management Work up for primary malignancy, CT C/A/P + PET Steroids are generally indicated for treatment of edema Decadron 10 mg IV to start; then transition to 4mg IV q6h with SSI Symptomatic tumors need eval by NSGY for resection consideration and radiation oncology Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Background Progressive weakness, often asymmetric and profound with no sensory loss Combination of LMN and UMN findings LMN findings: weakness, flaccidity, absent/decreased reflexes, fasciculations UMN findings: weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, pathologic reflexes (e.g. extensor plantar response), slow movements Pts with bulbar symptoms may complain of difficulty swallowing, changes in their voice, or increased saliva production (they just aren\u2019t swallowing it) Tongue fasciculations are fairly uncommon in other disorders and is a good clue for ALS if present (these can be hard to be certain of \u2013 tongue movements that are symmetric are typically not fasciculations) Pseudobulbar affect \u2013 inappropriate laughing or crying; relatively common in ALS FVC is an important marker for function Evaluation EMG/NCS is gold standard; El Escorial Criteria looks for evidence of UMN and LMN findings at cranial, cervical, thoracic and lumbosacral levels to determine if ALS or not Exclude mimicking lesions, which may be treatable (see below) Management Patients with ALS are ideally treated with a multidisciplinary team of Neurologists, Pulmonologists, Speech therapists, PT, OT and mobility Two medications have been shown to add a few months to survival: Riluzole - PO med; have to track CBC/LFTs.

This requires good clinical judgement as you wouldn't want to withhold Ativan and discover that the pt was having true atypical seizures. The compromise would be: do not repeatedly administer BZDs when there is suspicion for PNES as well as no evidence of response to prior BZD administration. Notably, syncopal convulsions are very common, with posturing and tonic-clonic movements happening for a few moments after syncope Should not last for more than 10-15 seconds These are just related to syncope and do not typically require seizure medications Workup: Two-hour EEG and MRI (with and without contrast) Infectious workup, BMP, CBC, blood glucose, toxicology/drug screen If there is concern for convulsive syncope, (carefully) check orthostatic vitals","title":"Seizures"},{"location":"neurology/neurology-brain-masses/","text":"Brain Masses \u00b6 Brain Masses Background Neoplasm is the biggest concern: ~ 90% of malignant brain masses are metastatic Other etiologies: abscess, tumefactive demyelinating lesions, vascular malformations, sometimes other causes of edema (e.g. paraneoplastic) Most common metastatic brain tumors: lung, RCC, breast, and melanoma Tumors with high bleeding risk: melanoma, thyroid, choriocarcinoma, and RCC Gliomas: WHO Grade I-IV, with IV being glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) GBM appears as large heterogeneous masses with edema; heterogenous contrast enhancement; can cross the corpus callosum Lower grade gliomas, which includes oligodendrogliomas and astroytomas Meningioma \u2013 usually low grade and either left alone and monitored, but can be symptomatic in which they are resected/radiated Ependymoma \u2013 uncommon, usually lower grade can cause CSF outflow obstruction CNS lymphoma \u2013 diffuse WM involvement, with mass effect, restricts diffusion on MRI with prominent contrast enhancement.

When the eyes get \u201cred,\u201d it is usually the conjunctiva, and not the sclera, that is irritated (conjunctival vessels dilate). Cornea - Transparent, bubble-like structure in front of the eye. Iris - \u201ccolored\u201d part of the eye that dilates and constricts the pupil to let in more or less light Pupil - the central hole in the iris Anterior Chamber (AC) - the space between the cornea and the iris Aqueous Humor - clear fluid that fills the anterior and posterior chambers, produced by the ciliary body. Nourishes the cornea. The balance of aqueous production and drainage dictates the intraocular pressure (IOP). Iridocorneal angle (or just, the Angle) - angle between the iris and the cornea and site of the Trabecular Meshwork, which drains aqueous humor from the anterior chamber into the ocular venous system. Lens - transparent structure located behind the iris that helps focus light onto the retina; also responsible for accommodation (focusing at near). Located behind the iris. A cataract is an opacification of the lens. Ciliary body - ring structure that sits behind the iris. Produces aqueous humor and suspends the Lens via filaments called Zonules. Posterior chamber - the space between the iris and the lens Vitreous chamber - the space between the lens and the retina Vitreous humor - thick, jelly-like transparent substance that fills the vitreous chamber Retina - tissue that lines the inner back wall of the eye, contains photoreceptors and interneurons that absorb light and convert it into visual electrochemical signals Macula - area of the retina responsible for central vision. The fovea is the center of the macula. Choroid - highly vascularized layer of tissue posterior to the retina Optic disc - head of the optic nerve; the optic nerve is composed of the axons of the retinal ganglion neurons, transmitting visual electrochemical signals from the retina to the brain. Uvea - iris + ciliary body + choroid. These 3 tissues are actually connected and collectively make up the vascular layer of the eye. The Anterior segment - all structures that make up the \u201cfront\u201d of the eye, i.e., anterior to the vitreous chamber (cornea, iris, iridocorneal angle, lens, ciliary body, aqueous humor) The Posterior segment - all structures that make up the \u201cback\u201d of the eye, i.e., the vitreous chamber and all structures contained within it (vitreous humor, retina, choroid, optic nerve) Common Abbreviations in Ophthalmology OD = Right eye | OS = Left eye | OU = Both eyes VA = Visual Acuity | VAcc = with correction [glasses or contact lenses] | VAsc = without correction PH = Pinhole acuity PHNI = No Improvement of vision with a pinhole Gtt = drop Ung = ointment EOM = Extraocular Muscles IOP = Intraocular Pressure CVF = Confrontational Visual Fields CF = Count Fingers HM = Hand Motion DFE = Dilated Fundus Exam | SLE = Slit Lamp Exam | PLE = Pen Light Exam RAPD = Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect KED = corneal epithelial defect (i.e., abrasion) PEE / SPK = corneal punctate epithelial erosions / superficial punctate keratopathy FBS = Foreign body sensation PFATs = Preservative-Free Artificial Tears SCH = Subconjunctival hemorrhage DD = Disc Diameters in size W&q = Conjunctiva is white and quiet (normal) D&q = Anterior chamber is deep and quiet (normal, without inflammation) AC = Anterior Chamber ON = Optic Nerve | ONH = Optic Nerve Head RD = Retinal Detachment PVD = Posterior Vitreous Detachment DR = Diabetic Retinopathy | NPDR: Nonproliferative DR | PDR: Proliferative DR CNV = Choroidal Neovascularization NVI = Neovascularization of the Iris | NVA = Neovascularization of the Angle | NVD = Neovascularization of the optic Disc | NVE = Neovascularization elsewhere (usually peripheral retina) CE/IOL = Cataract Extraction with IntraOcular Lens insertion (i.e., cataract surgery) IV = Intravitreal (as usually in \u201cIV injection\u201d) Taking a Good Ocular History History of Present Illness: Duration/Onset/Timing of visual or eye symptoms Eye pain? Quality/Severity? Symptoms constant or intermittent? Has this happened to you before? Any flashes/floaters/curtains/veils coming down in your field of vision? Timing of these? Any associated systemic symptoms (nausea/vomiting, fever/chills, headaches, neurologic deficits) Past Ocular History: Do you wear glasses? For distance or reading or both? Contact lenses? When was the last time you saw an eye doctor? History of eye surgeries? History of any other eye conditions? Cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy? Family History: Family history of any eye diseases? Glaucoma, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy? Social History: Use of tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs? Approach to Blurry Vision Key Points: This flowchart is meant to serve as a guide. Bear in mind that there are always exceptions. Many ocular problems are not urgent and can be dealt with outpatient. Assessing the acuity of onset is the first step. In general, the top differential for blurry vision is Dry Eye, Cataract, or Uncorrected refractive error. If the symptoms are acute and just in one eye, it is more likely to be ocular and warrants further investigation (likely ophthalmology consult). Approach to Double Vision (Diplopia) Key Points This flowchart is meant to serve as a guide. Bear in mind that there are always exceptions. Most important question to ask with any patient complaining of double vision is whether it goes away when covering one eye. If it does, then it is an ocular misalignment issue (= true binocular diplopia). If the diplopia is acute and constant, this requires more urgent evaluation than if intermittent. Look at the pupil and eye movements: If the eye is dilated (\u201cblown pupil\u201d), abducted and infraducted (\u201cdown and out position\u201d), and ptotic, this is classic for a complete CN3 palsy and requires immediate neuroimaging (e.g. CTA head) to rule out an enlarging aneurysm. Approach to Flashes, Floaters, Spots Key Points This flowchart is meant to serve as a guide. Bear in mind that there are always exceptions. Scintillating or colorful lights/spots, especially if bilateral, are likely migrainous in nature. A patient may say they see a visual disturbance in the left eye, when in reality it is in the left visual field of both eyes (indicating that it is a neurological issue, e.g., migraine). Ask if the patient has tried closing one eye to see if the visual phenomenon is actually in one eye. Rapid onset of floaters, often preceded by a peripheral crescent-shaped light flash, is classic for posterior vitreous detachment. A black curtain or veil that comes down in the vision is classic for retinal detachment. Approach to a Red Eye When the conjunctiva is vasodilated, or \u201cinjected,\u201d the eye looks red. The more inflamed the conjunctiva, the angrier-looking the eye. Differential for Red Eye: Dry Eye Trace diffuse injection, blurry vision that fluctuates, gritty sensation, clears with blinking Corneal abrasion / ulceration / exposure keratopathy Unilateral, moderate to severe injection, may be diffuse or sectoral, pain, blurry vision, mucus discharge, history of poor blink rate, intubated/sedated status. Subconjunctival hemorrhage Patch of bright red, often with sharp borders. Due to rupture of conjunctival vessel. Whole conjunctiva can be involved and may be bright red. Looks scarier than it is. Common in patients on anticoagulation or after a Valsalva event (e.g., coughing). Will resolve spontaneously. Allergic conjunctivitis Chemosis, mild to moderate injection, blurry vision, very itchy, watery discharge, hx of allergies/atopy Viral or Bacterial conjunctivitis Moderate to severe injection, scattered subconjunctival hemorrhages or petechiae, itchy or burning/painful eyes. If viral, look for preauricular adenopathy or recent URI. Acute angle closure glaucoma Severe eye pain with nausea/vomiting, rock-hard eye, mid-dilated and fixed pupil, blurry vision Uveitis/Episcleritis/Scleritis Eye pain, perilimbal injection (\u201cciliary flush\u201d), blurry vision, may have history of autoimmune disease. Episcleritis vs Scleritis can be difficult to discern. Scleritis may have a deeper, violaceous hue. Endophthalmitis Eye pain, history of trauma or eye surgery, severe vision loss, history of immunocompromise and systemic infection (if endogenous) Carotid-cavernous fistula Engorged and tortuous conjunctival vessels, recent history of trauma, resistance to retropulsion (pushing the globe back in) Anisocoria Background Anisocoria = unequal pupil size Constriction of the pupil is driven by parasympathetic innervation; Dilation by sympathetic innervation Physiological anisocoria = pupil sizes differ by \\<1mm. Normal. Conditions that can cause anisocoria: Benign episodic mydriasis Intermittent episodes of pupillary dilation and possible association with migraine. No other significant neurologic or ocular symptoms present. Important to exclude other causes of mydriasis prior to this diagnosis. Horner\u2019s syndrome Pupillary miosis + ipsilateral upper lid ptosis May be congenital or acquired Acquired causes include: trauma involving sympathetic pathway, carotid dissection, cavernous sinus pathology, stroke, neck or thoracic surgery, or Pancoast / mediastinal tumor (rare). If suspect new onset Horner\u2019s, consider Neurology and Ophthalmology consult. CN3 Palsy Pupillary mydriasis (\u201cblown pupil\u201d) + adduction, supraduction, infraduction deficit, \u201cdown and out position\u201d, upper lid ptosis. Must rule out a compressive lesion on CN3. If new onset, consider head imaging and Neurology and Ophthalmology consult Medications (especially anticholinergics) Commonly seen in young patients with scopolamine patches who forget to wash hands after handling the patch; dilation can last one day to a couple weeks. Trauma Damage to the iris sphincter after eye trauma can cause a dilated pupil that is poorly reactive to light. Eye surgery Patients who have undergone intraocular surgery (like cataract surgery) may have an irregularly shaped, less reactive, and slightly dilated pupil as compared to the other eye due to damage or stretching of the iris during the operation. Infections Viral infections and syphilis can cause parasympathetic denervation, resulting in a relatively mydriatic pupil that is poorly reactive to light. However, the accommodative pupillary response (i.e., constriction at focusing on an object at near) may be intact. \u201cAdie\u2019s Tonic Pupil\u201d = Idiopathic cause of parasympathetic denervation presenting similarly as above. However, viruses (HSV) are sometimes thought to be behind idiopathic cases. Acute angle closure glaucoma During an acute attack, the pupil may be mid-dilated and sluggish to light. However, patients will also have symptoms of acute angle closure (e.g., headaches, nausea/vomiting, eye pain, etc. See Glaucoma section for more info). Conjunctivitis Background and Presentation Allergic, viral, or bacterial cause All forms present with red and irritated conjunctiva In practice it can be difficult to distinguish between the types of conjunctivitis. However, these are rough guidelines: Allergic: hx of allergies/atopy, bilateral, chemosis, watery/mucoid discharge, itchiness predominant symptom Viral: hx of recent URI or exposure, unilateral first then bilateral, itchy/burning, subconjunctival hemorrhages or petechiae, watery/mucoid discharge, tender preauricular lymph nodes Bacterial: itching less prominent, burning/aching/stabbing discomfort predominates, unilateral first then bilateral, mucoid/purulent discharge (and more copious) Blurry vision is common, but loss of vision should not occur if disease limited to conjunctiva. Management: Allergic: eliminate allergen, artificial tears, antihistamine/mast-cell stabilizer drops (olopatadine, ketotifen), oral antihistamine (diphenhydramine, loratadine) Viral: 4-8x/day artificial tears, cold compresses, isolation precautions. Bacterial: culture/swab the ocular discharge, isolation precautions, moxifloxacin drops (Vigamox) QID or trimethoprim/polymyxin B drops/ointment for 5-7 days Consult ophthalmology if concern for worsening Corneal Abrasion, Exposure Keratopathy, Ulceration Background Corneal abrasion = corneal epithelial defect (KED): an area of missing corneal epithelium. This is akin to a scratch on the skin. Most common causes include trauma, excessive surface dryness, infection, and neurotrophic disease Exposure keratopathy = development of corneal epithelial defects secondary to incomplete closure of the eyelids (i.e., prolonged exposure of the cornea to air). Most often occurs in patients who are intubated/sedated, have poor orbicularis tone/paralysis (Bell palsy), or have abnormal blink rate (e.g., Parkinson\u2019s). Corneal ulceration = the injury extends past the corneal epithelium and \u2018ulcerates\u2019 into the underlying stroma. Ulcerations are often infectious and develop after untreated abrasions (abrasions are essentially open wounds). In rare cases ulcerations can also be sterile (autoimmune/inflammatory). Presentation and Evaluation Abrasions and ulcerations are often extremely painful. May be exacerbated by blinking. Conjunctival injection; but sometimes the eye can appear normal, or only have trace redness, and the pain may seem out of proportion to external appearance. Mucus discharge /crusting Photophobia and tearing Blurry vision Ulcerations will present with the above, but also have a whitish infiltrate in the cornea. The conjunctival injection and discharge will often be a lot worse. 1 drop of Proparacaine 0.5% will improve pain Note: Proparacaine is used only for diagnostic, and not therapeutic, purposes. Do not administer proparacaine on a scheduled or PRN basis for pain. The duration of action is only 15 minutes, and repeated chronic use can lead to corneal melt/ulceration. 1 drop of Fluorescein followed by shining a blue light (or Wood\u2019s lamp) will reveal the KED. Management VUMC Perioperative Corneal Abrasion Protocol If patient is recently postop, or underwent recent extubation, and presents with eye pain/burning, blurry vision, redness, photophobia, VUMC has a periop corneal abrasion protocol (do not place ophthalmology consult): Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment TID into the lower fornix of eye x5 days If the pain and redness do not improve within 48 hours, then consult ophthalmology Corneal Abrasion If patient\u2019s signs and symptoms are consistent with a corneal abrasion, try erythromycin ophthalmic ointment TID as above. If the pain and redness do not improve within 48 hours, or have other concerns, consult ophthalmology Exposure Keratopathy If patient is intubated and sedated, or cannot otherwise fully close his/her eyes, take the following measures to prevent development of corneal abrasion or ulceration: Moisture chambers (aka bubble shields) to eyes at all times Copious amount of lubricating ophthalmic ointment (e.g., Lubrifresh) in eyes TID Corneal Ulceration If you see whitish material in the cornea itself, this is likely a corneal ulceration and warrants an ophthalmology consult. Cataracts Background Opacification of the eye\u2019s natural lens Primary cause is normal aging, occurs bilaterally and symmetrically Other causes include congenital, trauma, and medications (esp chronic / long-term steroid use Presentation Most common symptoms include progressive decreased vision over years, increased glare, increased difficulty with night vision Evaluation and Management Unless the cataracts are dense enough, it is difficult to appreciate without a slit lamp exam Please place an outpatient referral. Dry Eye Background Most common ocular complaint, especially amongst patients admitted to the hospital! Due to insufficient tear production and/or imbalance in the components that make up the tear film Etiology is vast and can include aging, eye strain/overuse, contact lens use, systemic and topical medications, post eye surgery, nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune disease, or concomitant with other ocular conditions. Presentation Blurry vision bilaterally that comes and goes (very common\u2013if the patient complains of fluctuating blurriness, Dry Eye should be at the top of your differential!) Excessive tearing /watery eyes Stinging, burning, soreness, discomfort, gritty/foreign body sensation Discomfort with eye movements Trace/mild conjunctival injection Evaluation and Management If a patient's symptoms sound like Dry Eye, order some preservative-free (PF) artificial tears at least 4x/day and lubricating eye ointment at bedtime to see if the patient's symptoms improve. Polyvinyl alcohol-povidone PF (Refresh Classic) Lubricating ophthalmic ointment (Lubrifresh) Order them SCHEDULED. Do not order these eye drops PRN (patients will not ask for them). If a patient's symptoms fail to improve or worsen on artificial tears, consider paging ophthalmology for additional assistance. If there is no apparent imminent threat to vision, you can place an ophthalmology outpatient referral upon discharge. Fungemia and Intraocular Involvement The American Academy of Ophthalmology currently does NOT recommend routine Ophthalmology consults for visually asymptomatic patients with systemic candidemia. The incidence of candidemia-related endophthalmitis detected from routine screenings is \\<1%. By contrast, if the patient has visual symptoms, an Ophthalmology consult is warranted. Breazzano MP et al. American Academy of Ophthalmology Recommendations on Screening for Endogenous Candida Endophthalmitis. Ophthalmology. 2022 Jan;129(1):73-76. Giant Cell Arteritis: Role of Ophthalmology If a patient has systemic symptoms suspect of GCA (see \u201cRheumatology section\u201d), when is it appropriate to consult Ophthalmology? If patient HAS visual symptoms (acute vision loss, new onset diplopia), consult ophthalmology. If patient DOES NOT have visual symptoms, DO NOT consult ophthalmology (e.g., to rule out \u201cretinal vasculitis.\u201d) It is extremely unlikely that Ophthalmology will find a pertinent ocular finding in the absence of visual symptoms to support a diagnosis of GCA. Bottom line: If you suspect GCA given the other systemic symptoms (regardless of visual status), treat promptly with high dose steroids! Temporal Artery biopsies are typically performed by Vascular Surgery. Glaucoma Background Glaucoma is a disease of the optic nerve that follows a characteristic pattern of optic nerve fiber degeneration. High intraocular pressure (IOP) is believed to be the main etiology of the disease. While the \u201cnormal\u201d IOP range is between 11 and 21 mmHg, there are individuals who have a pressure above 21 that do NOT develop glaucoma. Conversely, there are individuals who have a pressure in the normal range that DO develop glaucoma (= Normal Tension Glaucoma). Aqueous humor fills the anterior chamber and drains through a sieve-like structure called the trabecular meshwork (TM), located in the angle between the iris and the cornea. After passing through TM, aqueous drains into the eye\u2019s venous system. Impediment to aqueous flow will cause elevated IOP. Presentation All glaucomas generally cause progressive peripheral visual field loss that ultimately encroaches on central fixation and leads to irreversible blindness if left untreated. A glaucomatous optic nerve is often described as \u201ccupped\u201d Presents in an acute or chronic fashion: Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma The iridocorneal angle rapidly closes, blocking aqueous drainage and causing a sudden rise in IOP (usually >40mmHg). Symptoms and Signs: intense eye or orbital pain, headache, nausea/vomiting, blurred vision, halos around lights, fixed and mid-dilated pupil, rock-hard eye, conjunctival redness, cloudy cornea. Usually unilateral, but occasionally can be bilateral. Classic trigger is a pupil-dilating factor (e.g., dark environment or anticholinergic medications) in a person with anatomically narrow angles. If IOP is not lowered within hours, permanent optic nerve damage and vision loss will likely occur. Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) The iridocorneal angle is open, but due to inadequately functioning TM (or other mechanism) aqueous does not drain properly and IOP is chronically elevated. POAG is often painless and without noticeable vision changes in the early stage of disease. Individuals can go undiagnosed for years, sitting at an IOP of say 30mmHg, without being aware they are losing vision until the vision loss is severe. POAG is the most common glaucoma in the US. When a patient says they have a history of glaucoma, they probably have POAG. Evaluation and Management Primary Open Angle: Continue the patient\u2019s home glaucoma drops; caution if they develop a medical condition that results in a contraindication (See table below) No need to officially place an Ophthalmology consult to order a patient\u2019s home glaucoma drops; feel free to page Ophthalmology if you have questions. Pro tip: Often patients will remember the cap color of the drops they take but not the names! Name (brand) Cap color Class Dosing Possible side effects Relative contraindications Timolol (Timoptic) Yellow Nonselective beta-blocker BID Bradycardia, bronchospasm, hypotension Heart conditions (CHF, heart block), asthma/COPD Latanoprost (Xalatan) Teal Prostaglandin analogue QHS Flulike symptoms, joint pains Pregnancy (category C), uveitis Brimonidine (Alphagan) Purple Alpha-2 agonist BID-TID Allergic conjunctivitis, CNS depression, bradycardia Infants and young children Dorzolamide (Trusopt) Orange Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor BID Acidosis, hypokalemia, malaise, GI upset, metallic taste Renal insufficiency, Hepatic cirrhosis, Sickle cell disease, caution when using with other K-wasting drugs Acetazolamide (Diamox) PO PO tablet Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor 250mg BID-QID Same as dorzolamide, but side effects more likely to occur given PO Same as dorzolamide, but side effects more likely to occur given PO Cosopt (Blue cap) = dorzolamide + timolol Combigan (Purple cap) = brimonidine + timolol Acute Angle Closure: If suspect acute angle closure given the signs described above, consult Ophthalmology ASAP. The goal is to lower the IOP ASAP. Target is \\<30mmHg. Administer frequent rotating rounds of all the IOP-lowering drops: 1 drop of Cosopt (then wait 5 minutes), followed by Brimonidine (then wait 5 minutes), followed by Latanoprost (then wait 5 minutes)--then keep repeating the cycle until the IOP goes down. Concurrently, administer one dose of IV Diamox 500mg if not contraindicated (e.g., renal insufficiency or hepatic cirrhosis). Ophthalmology will recheck the IOP every hour or so to ensure that the IOP is responding (usually it does). If the IOP does not respond, patient will need a bedside AC tap to offload aqueous and lower the pressure. Patient should ultimately get a Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI) to avoid future angle-closure attacks, which is typically performed as an outpatient procedure. Orbital vs Preseptal Cellulitis Background The septum is a fibrous, membranous structure that divides the anterior from the posterior orbit. Preseptal cellulitis = infection is bound anterior to the septum Orbital cellulitis (AKA postseptal cellulitis) = infection extends posterior to the septum Common risk factors/etiologies: URI, acute or chronic sinusitis, trauma, tooth abscess, stye or other local/adjacent skin infection/condition, local/adjacent bug bite, immunocompromised state, underlying systemic infection Often bacterial cause (gram positive Staph or Strep species, and/or gram negative anaerobic species like Peptococcus or Bacteroides). Consider fungal infection (Aspergillus, Mucor) in immunocompromised or diabetic patients. Presentation Preseptal Cellulitis Can be Present in Either Orbital Cellulitis -Patient less toxic appearing No visual compromise -Mild conjunctival injection, no to minimal chemosis -No or minimal limitation of eye movements -No or minimal proptosis -Symptoms improving with PO antibiotics -Erythema and Edema of eyelids (upper and/or lower) and periorbital skin -Fever (although more likely in Orbital cellulitis) -Difficulty opening the eye d/t swelling -Blurry vision -Tearing/ocular discharge -Patient more toxic appearing -Pain with eye movements -Limitation of eye movements +/- diplopia -Proptosis -Severe conjunctival injection + chemosis -Vision may be compromised -Symptoms not improving after course of PO antibiotics Evaluation Vital signs Labs: CBC, CMP, ESR, CRP, blood cultures, wound culture if any open draining areas Imaging: CT orbits with and without contrast Daily or BID photographs to track progression You can use the LRINEC scale to help assess whether the infection is necrotizing: https://www.mdcalc.com/lrinec-score-necrotizing-soft-tissue-infection . Necrotizing soft tissue infections should be addressed immediately and undergo surgical debridement ASAP. Management Preseptal cellulitis can usually be managed on an outpatient basis with PO antibiotics (e.g. augmentin) with close followup. However, if condition is worsening, if there is failure to improve on PO antibiotics, or if concerned for postseptal extension (i.e., that the preseptal cellulitis has evolved into an orbital cellulitis), management generally includes: IV broad spectrum antibiotics (usually Unasyn + Vancomycin to start if no intracranial extension; could also do Vancomycin + Ceftriaxone + Flagyl) Ophthalmology Consult Consider ID consult Consider ENT consult if concomitant sinus disease (most of the time there is) Consider OMFS consult if suspect etiology is odontogenic Tobradex eye drops QID to affected eye Nasal toilet (afrin, flonase, nasal saline)--usually dictated by ENT Warm compresses at least QID to affected eye Trend daily CRP If there is failure to improve on the above regimen, a large orbital abscess, optic nerve stretch on CT scan, evidence of necrotizing infection, or visual compromise, the patient may need to undergo surgical drainage. Optic Neuritis Background Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve. Often caused by demyelinating disease (e.g., Multiple sclerosis). Less often, can be caused by infection (viral etiology, bartonella, Lyme, syphilis, TB, toxoplasmosis) or infiltrative process (e.g., sarcoidosis, malignancy). Presentation Symptoms include scotoma, constant blurry vision or blurred spot, pain with eye movements, along with other systemic neurologic symptoms (if demyelinating process) If patient is of age 20s-40s and female, autoimmune/demyelinating disease is at top of the differential If patient is older, consider other causes If patient is immunocompromised, infectious etiology becomes more likely Evaluation Consult both Ophthalmology and Neurology if concerned for an optic neuritis MRI brain and orbits with and without contrast, thin slices, fat suppression If no contraindications to imaging, obtain LP with CSF studies (glucose, protein, cell count, Gram stain, bacterial/viral cultures, RPR/VDRL, oligos, consider NMO/AQP4) Management High dose IV methylprednisolone If vision continues to worsen and/or presence of other systemic neurologic symptoms despite steroid treatment, consider escalation to PLEX therapy with assistance of neurology Papilledema Background Papilledema refers to edema of the optic nerve due to increased intracranial pressure Ophthalmology is often consulted to rule out papilledema in patients who fit the \u201cIdiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)\u201d profile, or with patients with other reasons for high ICP Presentation Symptoms of increased ICP: headaches that vary with position (often worse with bending over), nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness/meningismus, pulsatile tinnitus, fevers/chills Visual symptoms of papilledema: transient visual obscurations, dimming of vision, blurry vision, loss of color vision/red desaturation, loss of peripheral vision, scotoma. Evaluation and Management Consult Ophthalmology and Neurology if concerned for papilledema. Neurosurgery should be involved if there is concern for shunt failure or other neurosurgical problem. Ophthalmology / Neurology will advise on what imaging to order (usually MRI / MRV brain with and without contrast, + MRI Orbits with and without contrast and fat suppression) If no contraindications after imaging, obtain LP with opening pressure, with CSF sent for cells, protein, glucose, and infectious/neoplastic workup where appropriate Ophthalmology / Neurology may recommend initiation of PO or IV acetazolamide (Diamox). These may be contraindicated or need to be renally dosed if the patient has chronic kidney disease. Retinal Detachment and Posterior Vitreous Detachment Background Retinal detachment (RD) = detachment of retinal tissue from the back of the eye. Risk factors include trauma, high myopia (nearsightedness), older age, history of RD in the other eye, prior eye surgery, and family history. Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD) = detachment of vitreous (jelly) from the retina. PVDs eventually will happen to all adults as the vitreous liquefies and shrivels with age. Some are asymptomatic. PVDs can lead to RDs, but not always. As the vitreous peels away from the underlying retina, vitreous can pull a piece of retina with it, causing a retinal tear. The retinal tear, if not treated, can evolve into an RD. Presentation and Evaluation Both can present with acute flashes and floaters However, RDs will often present with a black curtain or veil that comes down somewhere in the patient\u2019s field of vision. PVDs may result in blurriness, but will not present with veils, scotomas, or severe loss of vision. Management If patient presents with acute flashes, floaters, and/or black curtains in field of vision in one eye, consult ophthalmology. If not acute, or if symptoms occur in both eyes simultaneously, chances are this is not a PVD or an RD. See Approach to Flashes, Floaters, Spots. Uveitis (includes Iritis, Cyclitis, Retinitis, Choroiditis) Background \u201dUvea\u201d = iris + ciliary body + choroid (these 3 tissues are connected and make up the vascular layer of the eye) Uveitis = inflammation of either or all of these structures. However, \u201cuveitis\u201d is a bit of a misnomer, since it is used to denote inflammation of any ocular component Uveitis is usually associated with autoimmune conditions, but infections can also cause uveitis. Anterior Uveitis Intermediate Uveitis Posterior Uveitis Panuveitis Practical synonyms Iritis Pars planitis, Cyclitis Retinitis, Choroiditis, Chorioretinitis Diffuse uveitis Definition Inflammation localized to the anterior segment Inflammation localized to the vitreous cavity and pars plana Inflammation localized to choroid and retina Inflammation involving the anterior, intermediate, and posterior structures Symptoms Vision loss Usually painful Perilimbal redness Vision loss Pain varies Vision loss Pain varies Vision loss Pain varies Common etiologies Idiopathic HLA-B27 IBD, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis Spillover from anterior uveitis Multiple sclerosis Lymphoma Sarcoid Syphilis TB Immunocompromised (HIV, transplant) CMV, HSV, VZV Vasculitis Sarcoidosis Toxoplasmosis Syphilis TB Lymphoma Behcet\u2019s disease Sarcoid Syphilis TB Toxoplasmosis Management If you suspect a patient has uveitis, consult ophthalmology for evaluation. Patients with any of the above associated systemic conditions (e.g., IBD) do not need an inpatient Ophthalmology consult unless the patient has visual symptoms. Referral to outpatient Ophthalmology is appropriate for routine screening. Wilson\u2019s Disease: Ophthalmic Manifestations The two classic ophthalmic manifestations of Wilson\u2019s disease are the \u201cKayser-Fleischer ring\u201d (copper deposition around the corneal limbus) and the \u201cSunflower cataract\u201d (copper deposition in the lens). Wilson\u2019s disease rarely affects vision (unless the sunflower cataract is very advanced). Unless the disease is very advanced/has been present for years, it is impossible for one to detect subtle copper deposition in the cornea, iridocorneal angle, or lens without an office-based slit lamp exam and gonioscopy (only available in the outpatient setting). Furthermore, the presence or absence of a Kayser-Fleischer ring does not rule in or rule out the disease Testing for decreased ceruloplasmin, urinary copper levels, and genetic testing are more effective diagnostic methods. If concerned about the visual impact of a developing sunflower cataract, an outpatient ophthalmology referral is appropriate.","title":"Main"},{"location":"outpatient-medicine/main/","text":"Obesity/Nutrition \u2013 Mackenzie Samson Background BMI = Body Weight (kg) / Height (meters)2 Underweight = BMI \\<18.5 Normal = BMI 18.5-24.9 Overweight = BMI 25.0-29.9 Obesity: Class I 30-34.9 Class II 35-39.9 Class IIIA 40-44.9 Class IIIB 45-49.9 Class IIIC 50+ Management Goals: Target initial weight loss of 5-7% body weight, schedule frequent follow up to assess progress.

Is resuscitation a reversible treatment in this patient\u2019s case? What are the chances that this patient will survive to discharge following CPR? Is the anticipated outcome in line with the patient\u2019s goals? After you have made your assessment, help patient make an educated decision based on both the efficacy of resuscitation and the patient\u2019s goals Below are examples of phrases that can be used in framing code status. NEVER say \u201cDo you want us to do everything?\u201d Most patients will respond yes to this even if they do not want CPR It is more helpful to give examples of when these situations would arise and make recommendations based on your medical judgment factoring in patient's goals Admitting a patient: Introduction : Normalize the conversation by stating \u201cthese are questions we routinely ask everyone when they come into the hospital. This is a way for us to understand your wishes in the event you are unable to make your own decisions.\u201d Surrogate : \u201cIf you were unable to make decisions for yourself, who would you trust to make your decisions? The person you pick should be able to speak to your wishes and make the same choices you would make for yourself\u201d - Intubation : Always do this first so you can avoid the sticky DNI but not DNR situation. Again, normalize the question. \u201cEveryone has different opinions on what types of medical care they would want if they became sicker. One of the things we like to talk about are ventilators or breathing machines. Some tell us to try a breathing machine for a trial, but they would not want to be kept alive on a ventilator.\u201d Now make a recommendation. \u201cIn your case I think if you were to need a ventilator, I think it would [work, not work,]\u201d Pause and allow them to ask questions. Also remember that if they say DNI, then they must be DNR because intubation occurs with ACLS (this is not allowed at VUMC. It is technically allowed at the VA if the patient specifically requests but would not recommend routinely providing this option) CPR : Prime this question with \u201cThe next question I have to ask you can be hard to think about, but it is important that we know what you would want in an emergency. Specifically, if you had a cardiac arrest where your heart stops beating and you die, would you want chest compressions to try and restart your heart? We know based on the evidence that CPR is not always successful. It really depends on the situation. In your case, I think CPR would be (make a recommendation here). Knowing this, would you want us to attempt CPR to resuscitate you?\u201d A helpful way to share data about the success of CPR: \u201cCan I share some numbers about how often CPR can help?\u201d Sometimes using fingers to show these numbers helps. \u201cIf you take 10 people in this hospital and all of their hearts stop beating, which would mean they have died, and we get to them as fast as possible, only 3 of them would have their hearts restarted and only 1 of them would ever leave the hospital.\u201d What if you do not think performing CPR Is medically appropriate?\u2026 At the end of the day, it is their decision (attendings may change the code status out of medical futility in Tennessee) Code status can be revisited throughout the hospital stay, especially if the patient was initially overwhelmed or if their clinical status evolves. Sometimes patients find it helpful to have a family member or friend present Consider framing the discussion differently and offer your recommendation: \u201cWhile you are in the hospital, we will support you with interventions and medications that we think are helpful based on what you have told us important to you. However, we are worried that some of the interventions you are asking for may do more harm than good. Many people think that CPR works like it does on TV. Unfortunately, we know that most patients who need CPR in the hospital do not survive like they do on TV. In your case, we do not think it would bring you back to your current state. I worry that this is not something that will be helpful to you.\u201d Another phrase that is helpful (and when the discussion occurs with surrogates leads to higher rates of changing code status than saying DNR): \u201callow for a natural death\u201d. For example, \u201cI worry that given how sick your [loved one] is, that the additional interventions of CPR if she were to die, would prevent her from having a natural death\u201d Opioids: General Principles & Conversion \u2013 Eli Cohen Oral Morphine Equivalent (OME) Conversion Table: Drug PO IV APAP IR ER Notes Tramadol 0.1x - - Tramadol Ultram ER\u2122 NSAID properties Morphine 1x 3x - Morphine IR MS-Contin\u2122 Renally cleared Hydrocodone 1x NA Lortab Hydrocodone NA Oxycodone 1.5x - Percocet Roxicodone\u2122 Oxycontin\u2122 Hydromorphone 4x 20x - IV, Oral - Oral is $ Fentanyl 300x 300x - IV\u2019 Buccal, Nasal Patch Dosed in ug, not mg Abbreviations: ER = extended release; IR = immediate release; APAP = acetaminophen Conversion: Transition between opiates is done using oral morphine equivalents (OMEs). Each drugs\u2019 potency is compared to oral morphine (see table). Ex: 1 mg IV morphine = 3 mg PO morphine When transitioning, doses are traditionally reduced by \u00bc to \u2153 due to cross tolerance IR/ER regimens: Consider switching to extended release when requiring 3-4 doses of intermediate release (IR) medications in a 24-hour period regularly. The ER medication should treat the chronic pain experienced by a patient. The IR preparation is indicated for breakthrough pain. The IR dose should be calculated as 10-20% of the total OME dose a patient takes daily. Fentanyl patches should last 72 hours Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCAs) Pumps can be programmed to deliver a continuous rate and/or a bolus dose Basal rate = a continuous infusion dosed per hour that cannot be adjusted by the patient Demand dose = a patient-directed bolus that is given at a prescribed frequency whenever the pt presses the button. Both the dose and frequency can be adjusted The general rule of thumb is to calculate the total OME delivered through the demand when a pt is in steady state and convert 75% of this dose into the total continuous rate. Calculating initial doses: Basal dose: check what the patient is actually taking at home (may be different than what is prescribed, use OME). Take the total daily dose and convert to IV and then divide that by 24 hours to get an hourly rate. If moderate pain, increase dose by 25-50%; if severe, by 50-100% Demand doses: The bolus dose should be 10-20% of total daily dose. The availability is based on half-life of the medication (2hr for IV). Adjust the availability based on how frequently you want patient to be able to have a demand dose (ex: if q10min divide by 12 or if q15min divide by 8 for 2 hours) Don\u2019t forget to set lock-outs (maximum dose that can be given over a certain period of time) that includes both basal and demand doses Remember that the basal rate will not get to steady state for at least 8 hrs; When you admit pts or are transitioning pts to a PCA, always initiate the PCA pump with a bolus (or loading) dose How to Order PCA at VUMC Select Analgesic: *Hydromorphone (most common): Order \u201cHydromorphone (DILAUDID) PCA\u201d Fentanyl (if on at home; not a good inpatient PCA): Order \u201cFentanyl PCA\u201d *Morphine: Order \u201cMorphine PCA\u201d Select \u201c[Analgesic] PCA syringe\u201d and adjust the following to pt needs: PCA Dose (\u201cDemand\u201d): amount the patient gets when s/he presses the button Lockout Interval: time between which \u201cdemand\u201d doses will not be administered if s/he presses the button (i.e., the PCA \u201clocks out\u201d) Continuous Dose (\u201cBasal\u201d): amount the pt gets per hr in continuous infusion Max Dose: maximum amount of analgesic (Basal + Demand) pt can get in 24 hours Select all \u201cPCA Nursing Orders\u201d How to Order PCA at VA Under Orders, select \u201cPain/Sedation Infusions\u201d Under \u201cPCAs,\u201d select Analgesic of choice (Hydromorphone or Morphine) Adjust the following: Load: amount the pt will receive on initial set up of PCA Basal: amount the pt gets per hour in continuous infusion Demand: amount the pt gets when s/he presses the button Interrogating PCA (to determine amount of analgesia pt received): Look at IV pump display and hit \u201cChannel Select\u201d on PCA Select \u201cOptions\u201d in bottom left of IV pump Select \u201cPatient History\u201d on the left of the screen.

If pt has opioids, they need robust bowel regimen (MiraLAX, senna) with goal of BM \u2265every 3 days For opioid-specific constipation can do SQ Relistor TM (methylnaltrexone) but this is expensive and can only be given in the PCU or oncology floors at VUMC. For patients with chronic opioid-induced constipation as an outpatient can trial oral agents like Movantik TM (naloxgeol). Can also consider PO naloxone but it does have small amount of bioavailability so watch for systemic reversal Nausea: occurs with opiate na\u00efve pts. Consider starting an anti-emetic concurrently. Most pts will develop tachyphylaxis with this over a day, so the antiemetic can be discontinued Urinary retention: Consider role of opioids in pts with new-onset or worsening urinary retention. Try to de-escalate opioid dosing if possible Overdose: In pts with apneic emergency, IV 0.4 mg Naloxone; however, low threshold for multiple doses until response. For pts prescribed opioids as outpatient, need naloxone 4 mg intranasal If a patient with chronic opiate dependence is over sedated but not in immediate danger of respiratory failure, one can 1) hold the dose of opioid and let them wake up on their own or 2) give a dose of naloxone 0.02-0.04mg (1/10 of the usual dose). This latter strategy prevents opioid withdrawal and precipitation of pain crisis in patients on chronic opioids Pruritis: due to histamine release from mast cells; can be treated with antihistamines. The opioid can also be rotated. Some but not all pts will develop tachyphylaxis to this symptom Toxicity: hyperalgesia and neuroexcitatory effects (AMS, myoclonic jerking, seizures). Risk factors for neuroexcitatory effects are rapid titration, dehydration, and/or renal failure. Treatment is to rotate to a higher potency opioid and hydrate when possible Acute and Chronic Pain \u2013 Thomas Horton, Soibhan Kelley There are physiological AND emotional components to pain. Biopsychosocial factors must be addressed. Ex: anxiety/depression, physical debility, and poor social support. Many pts will never be completely free of pain, so it is important to set realistic expectations Central sensitization is a phenomenon where the nervous system persists in a state of high reactivity which lowers the threshold for pain stimuli. Two characteristics of centralized pain are allodynia (pain from non-painful stimuli) and hyperalgesia (painful stimuli perceived as more painful) Pharmacologic Therapy Acetaminophen: 650mg q6hr or 1g q8h. \\<3g/day. (\\<2g in liver patients) Avoid if you are worried about masking fevers NSAIDs: A great option for acute pain, especially musculoskeletal, HA, and nephrolithiasis in eligible patients (ex: IV/po ketorolac, ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.) Avoid in acute or chronic kidney disease and \u2191 risk of bleeding. Caution in CAD/PVD Topical Analgesics: Best for localized pain but utilized frequently as part of a multimodal regimen Lidocaine ointment, patches (PADR needed at VA for patches. Can get by saying contraindication to TCA/gabapentinoids/SNRIs due to sedation risk) Menthol salicylate gel Diclofenac Gel Capsaicin gel Morphine gel (typically limited to oncology patients with tumor breakdown through skin) Neuropathic Agents: Best for neuropathic pain but can be tried for other chronic pain or as part of acute pain regimen. SNRIs and TCAs can provide additional benefit if a pt has comorbid depression, anxiety, or insomnia (TCA). Most agents take 6-8 weeks for peak effect. Gabapentin (Initial: 100 to 300 mg 1 to 3 times daily). Can be used for acute pain Pregabalin (Initial: 25 to 150 mg/day in 2 to 3 divided doses). Has better bioavailability. May work in patients who did not tolerate or did not have success with gabapentin Duloxetine (Initial: 30 mg daily for 1 to 2 weeks, then increase to 60 mg daily as tolerated) Amitriptyline (Initial: 10 to 25 mg once daily at bedtime) Muscle Relaxants: Should be used temporarily and intermittently but some benefit from longer term use. Great for paraplegia, spinal injury, spasticity. Methocarbamol (Initial: 1.5 g 3 to 4 times daily for 2 to 3 days then decrease dose to \u22644.5 g/day in 3 to 4 divided doses). Preferred initial agent as has least SE. Tizanidine (Initial: 2 to 4 mg every 6 to 12 hours as needed and/or at bedtime) \u2013 important to watch out for withdrawal in patients that take frequently at home. Cyclobenzaprine (Initial: 5 to 10 mg once daily before bedtime) Metaxalone (Oral: 800 mg 3 to 4 times daily) Opioids: Frequently used in hospital for acute pain. Limit use as much as possible in chronic pain as contributes to long-term central sensitization.

Pick the video that best suits your purpose The Death Pronouncement \u2013 Michael J. Neuss This scenario arises in a variety of contexts, including the units, wards, and cross-cover. You might know the patient and family well, but particularly when cross covering, that may not be the case This approach to the death pronouncement is based in part on the AAFP\u2019s \u201cDeath Pronouncement: Survival Tips for Residents\u201d (Am Fam Physician. 1998 Jul 1;58(1):284-285.) Before Entering: Familiarize yourself with the most important points of the patient\u2019s hospitalization and recent events. Be aware of the circumstances of the patient\u2019s death, particularly whether death was expected or sudden. Inquire as to which family is present including whether the POA is currently at bedside In general, it is best to enter accompanied, ideally with the patient\u2019s nurse. It is rare for the chaplain to be present but that might also be a consideration. In The Room: Especially when cross-covering, make sure to introduce yourself to family, and allow them time to introduce themselves to you Less is more when it comes to what you say: it can be good to be empathetic (consider only short statements such as \u201cI am sorry for your loss\u201d) but focus mainly on the task at hand, allowing time for families to be present with their loved one Explain that you have been called to examine the patient to confirm that they have passed. Allow a brief time for questions; it is rare (but not impossible) that someone may wish to excuse themselves for the pronouncement Note the location of a working clock when you enter; your watch is ok too but do make sure to avoid looking at your smartphone to check the time of death The Exam and Pronouncement Identify the patient by wrist band Confirm that the patient does not respond to stimuli; one discreet way to confirm a lack of response to tactile stimuli is to hold the hand, and apply pressure to a nailbed, appearing to hold the hand while looking at/visually inspecting the face or other part of the body Confirm the absence of spontaneous respirations and absence of heart sounds. Listen for a full minute as some patients have extended periods of apnea Examine the pupils and note the absence of pupillary light reflex Note the time at which your examination is completed. This is the time of death Make sure to ask if the family would like an autopsy to be performed. This is often overlooked, and as awkward as it might feel to ask for this, it is a requirement Make sure you have notified the attending of record *Please see further VA- and VUMC-specific guidance below Death Process at VUMC The key thing is to ensure that all components are completed in the \u201cDischarge as Deceased\u201d tab under the Transfer-Discharge screen EACH AND EVERY component of this tab must be completed before Decedent Affairs will accept the body Required steps: Cardiopulmonary Death Charting -> Select \u201cNew Reading\u201d and complete.

First ask yourself \u201cWhy would this pt code? Is resuscitation a reversible treatment in this pt\u2019s case? What are the chances that this pt will survive to discharge following CPR? Is the anticipated outcome in line with the pt\u2019s goals? After you have made your assessment, then make a recommendation based on both the efficacy of resuscitation and the patient\u2019s goals. (90-year-old male with an MI may survive CPR but may wish to die a natural death. A 35-year-old with advanced cancer may be willing to endure CPR even if the chance of success is miniscule) Sometimes it is difficult to ascertain, and you can ask your attending his/her thoughts. For example, a 40 y/o pt admitted with cellulitis should probably be full code however an 83 y/o pt with class IV NYHA heart failure, CKD4 and significant frailty should probably be DNR/DNI. It is important that you are incorporating 1) the pt\u2019s goals with 2) your understanding about the efficacy of CPR for that pt and help them come to an educated decision. Below are examples of phrases that can be used in framing code status. It is important to do this step wise. NEVER say \u201cDo you want us to do everything?\u201d This is a question very few people are okay with saying no to. It is more helpful to give examples of when these situations would arise. Admitting a patient: Introduction : Normalize the conversation by stating that \u201cthese are questions we routinely ask everyone when they come into the hospital. This is a way for us to understand your wishes in the event you are unable to make your own decisions.\u201d Otherwise, they can be caught off guard and not be able to meaningfully participate in the conversation. Surrogate : \u201cIf you were unable to make decisions for yourself for whatever reason, who would you trust to make your decisions?

If you think the pt didn\u2019t understand, or was overwhelmed, or the clinical situation has changed, you may want to go back and revisit the conversation, perhaps with another family or friend present. Some pts have seen CPR on a loved one and seen it be successful and others have only seen it on TV. These experiences greatly influence their decision. Consider framing the discussion differently and offer your recommendation: \u201cWhile you are in the hospital, we will support you with interventions and medications that we think are helpful based on what you have told us important to you. However, we are worried that some of the interventions you are asking for may do more harm than good. Many people think that CPR works like it does on TV. Unfortunately, we know that the vast majority of patients who need CPR in the hospital do not survive like they do on TV. In your case, we do not think it would bring you back to your current state. I worry that this is not something that will be helpful to you.\u201d Sometimes it can be more of a discussion after a patient says \u201cYes I would want CPR\u201d you can respond \u201cI understand and respect your choice\u2026 maybe we can talk more about this later, in particular if your health changes.\u201d Worried they may not understand CPR?

First ask yourself \u201cWhy would this pt code? Is resuscitation a reversible treatment in this pt\u2019s case? What are the chances that this pt will survive to discharge following CPR? Is the anticipated outcome in line with the pt\u2019s goals? After you have made your assessment, then make a recommendation based on both the efficacy of resuscitation and the patient\u2019s goals. (90-year-old male with an MI may survive CPR but may wish to die a natural death. A 35-year-old with advanced cancer may be willing to endure CPR even if the chance of success is miniscule) Sometimes it is difficult to ascertain, and you can ask your attending his/her thoughts. For example, a 40 y/o pt admitted with cellulitis should probably be full code however an 83 y/o pt with class IV NYHA heart failure, CKD4 and significant frailty should probably be DNR/DNI. It is important that you are incorporating 1) the pt\u2019s goals with 2) your understanding about the efficacy of CPR for that pt and help them come to an educated decision. Below are examples of phrases that can be used in framing code status. It is important to do this step wise. NEVER say \u201cDo you want us to do everything?\u201d This is a question very few people are okay with saying no to. It is more helpful to give examples of when these situations would arise. Admitting a patient: Introduction : Normalize the conversation by stating that \u201cthese are questions we routinely ask everyone when they come into the hospital. This is a way for us to understand your wishes in the event you are unable to make your own decisions.\u201d Otherwise, they can be caught off guard and not be able to meaningfully participate in the conversation. Surrogate : \u201cIf you were unable to make decisions for yourself for whatever reason, who would you trust to make your decisions? The person you pick does not have to be family but should be able to speak to your wishes and make the same choices you would make for yourself. [In a cirrhotic] For example, if you were to get confusion from your liver disease?\u201d Intubation : Always do this first so you can avoid the sticky DNI but not DNR situation.

Neuss This scenario arises in a variety of contexts, including the units, wards, and cross-cover. You might know the patient and family well, but particularly when cross covering, that may not be the case This approach to the death pronouncement is based in part on the AAFP\u2019s \u201cDeath Pronouncement: Survival Tips for Residents\u201d (Am Fam Physician. 1998 Jul 1;58(1):284-285.) Before Entering: Familiarize yourself with the most important points of the patient\u2019s hospitalization; it is ok to take a moment to read about the patient\u2019s course and inquire about the day\u2019s events with the patient\u2019s nurse or other staff. Inquire as to which family is present prior to entering, including whether the POA is currently at bedside. Be aware of the circumstances of the patient\u2019s death, particularly whether death was expected or sudden. In general, it is best to enter accompanied, ideally with the patient\u2019s nurse. It is rare for the chaplain to be present but that might also be a consideration. Inquire with the nurse if Tennessee Donor Services (TDS) has been notified; often, when death is anticipated, the nurse will already have done this, although that is not always the case. Remember that it is not your position/role to approach the family regarding organ donation, but TDS should have been notified and there should be a case number, which in Epic you will have to document. In The Room: Especially when cross-covering, make sure to introduce yourself to family, and allow them time to introduce themselves to you. Less is more when it comes to what you say: it can be good to be empathetic (consider only short statements such as \u201cI am sorry for your loss\u201d) but focus mainly on the task at hand, allowing time for families to be present with their loved one. Explain that you have been called to examine the patient to confirm that they have passed. Allow a brief time for questions; it is rare (but not impossible) that someone may wish to excuse themselves for the pronouncement, and although I do not commonly inquire if family would like to be present, this is a consideration. Note the location of a working clock when you enter; your watch is ok too but do make sure to avoid looking at your smartphone to check the time of death. The Exam And Pronouncement: Identify the patient by wrist band. Note general appearance. Confirm that the patient does not respond to stimuli; one discreet way to confirm a lack of response to tactile stimuli is to hold the hand, and apply pressure to a nailbed, appearing to hold the hand while looking at/visually inspecting the face or other part of the body. You should avoid any obvious painful stimuli, out of respect for the deceased as well as out of deference to family who may be present. Confirm the absence of spontaneous respirations. Confirm the absence of heart sounds. Examine the pupils and note the absence of pupillary light reflex. Note the time at which your examination is completed. This is the time of death. It is ok (although not required; this is merely a consideration) to speak the time of death quietly and respectfully, for the family\u2019s reference as well as staff\u2019s. Make sure to ask for an autopsy. This is often overlooked, and as awkward as it might feel to ask for this, it is a requirement and asking later (if overlooked) feels more awkward.

For example, 1 mg of IV morphine is equal to 3 mg of oral morphine. When transitioning, doses are traditionally reduced by \u00bc to \u2153 due to cross tolerance. (Oxycodone 5 is a pretty standard dose, which converts to 7.5 mg of oral morphine, 2.5 mg of iv morphine, and 0.375 of iv hydromorphone.) Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCAs) aka Pain Pumps: Pumps can be programmed to deliver a continuous rate and/or a bolus dose. The basal rate is a continuous infusion dosed per hour that cannot be adjusted by the patient. The demand dose is a patient-directed bolus that is given at a prescribed frequency (whenever the pt presses the button). Both the actual dose and frequency of bolus dose can be adjusted. The general rule of thumb is to calculate the total OME delivered through the demand when a pt is in steady state and convert 75% of this dose into the total continuous rate or basal infusion. Alternatively, if a pt is chronically on a long-acting opioid, this total amount of OME (sustained release) can be converted into a basal rate of opioid. The demand dose is 25% of the hourly rate given every 15 minutes. Remember that the basal rate will not get to steady state for at least 8 hrs; therefore, when you admit pts or are transitioning pts to a PCA, always initiate the PCA pump with a bolus (or loading) dose.

If it does not display info about PCA, hit \u201cChannel Select\u201d on PCA Select \u201cOptions\u201d in bottom left of IV pump Select \u201cPatient History\u201d on the left of the screen. This shows the administration history for a certain time period (e.g., 24h, 12h, 4h, etc) Hit \u201cZoom\u201d on bottom of screen to change time period to 24 hours. Should show: Total Drug: total amount of drug received in last 24 hours Total Demands: amount of times the pt has pushed the button for demand dose Delivered : amount of times the pt actually received a demand dose The difference between \u201cTotal Demands\u201d and \u201cDelivered\u201d is the number of times the patient pushed the button without receiving a dose (due to pushing the button during the lockout interval). If you have questions about interrogating the PCA, ask the nurses! They are a great resource! Opioid Side effects Constipation: dose-dependent and will not develop tolerance. If pt has opioids, they need robust bowel regimen (miralax, senna) with goal of BM \u2265 every 3 days. For opioid-specific constipation can do SQ Relistor (methylnaltrexone) but this is expensive and can only be given in the PCU or oncology floors at VUMC. For patients with chronic opioid-induced constipation as an outpatient can trial oral agents like Movantik (naloxgeol). Can also consider PO naloxone but it does have small amount of bioavailability so watch for systemic reversal. Nausea: occurs with opiate na\u00efve pts. Consider starting an anti-emetic concurrently. Most pts will develop tachyphylaxis with this over a day, so the antiemetic can be discontinued. Urinary retention: Consider role of opioids in pts with new-onset or worsening urinary retention. Try to de-escalate opioid dosing if possible. Overdose: In pts with apneic emergency, IV 0.4 mg Naloxone; however, low threshold for multiple doses until response. With respiratory depression in chronic opioid pts start with IV 0.02 mg q2-3min to avoid profound withdrawal. This helps prevent acute pain crisis. In pts taking long-acting opioids, may need to redose q30min and consider IV infusion for them. For pts prescribed opioids as outpatient, need naloxone 4 mg intransasal. Pruritis: due to histamine release from mast cells; can be treated with antihistamines. The opioid can also be rotated. Some but not all pts will develop tachyphylaxis to this symptom. Toxicity: hyperalgesia and neuroexcitatory effects (AMS, myoclonic jerking, seizures). Risk factors for neuroexcitatory effects are rapid titration, dehydration or renal failure.","title":"Opiate Principles"},{"location":"pain-and-palliative/pain-and-palliative-opiate-principles/#opiate-principles","text":"Opioids: General Principles & Conversion \u2013 Brian Grieb Oral Morphine Equivalent (OME) Conversion Table: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Drug PO IV APAP IR ER Notes Tramadol 0.1x - - Tramadol Ultram ER\u2122 NSAID properties Morphine 1x 3x - Morphine IR MS-Contin\u2122 Renally cleared Hydrocodone 1x NaN Lortab Hydrocodone NaN NaN Oxycodone 1.5x - Percocet Roxicodone\u2122 Oxycontin\u2122 NaN Hydromorphone 4x 20x - IV, Oral - Oral is $ Fentanyl 300x 300x - IV\u2019 Buccal, Nasal Patch Dosed in ug, not mg Abbreviations: ER, extended release; IR, immediate release; IV, intravenous; PO, oral; APAP, Acetaminophen Conversion: Transition between opiates is done using oral morphine equivalents (OMEs), in which each drugs\u2019 potency is compared to oral morphine (see table).

It differs from hypertonia in that hypertonia is resistance to passive stretch that is not velocity-dependent. Spasticity is believed to result from disruption of descending inhibitory modulation of the alpha motor neurons by an upper motor lesion, producing hyperexcitability. Grading (by the Modified Ashworth Scale) 0=no increase in tone 1=slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of ROM when affected part is moved in flexion or extension 1+=slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch followed by minimal resistance through the remainder of ROM (less than half) 2=more marked increase in muscle tone through most of ROM, but affected part is easily moved. 3=considerable increases in muscle tone; passive movement difficult 4=affected part is rigid in flexion or extension Management Spasticity can have functional benefits, including improving standing and transfers. However, it can also cause weakness, poor dexterity, pain, and contractures. If spasticity is having undesirable effects, first line of treatment is PT/OT and physical modalities such as stretching. Oral Medications Medication Mechanism of Action Side Effects/Important Considerations Baclofen GABA-B agonist sedation, fatigue, nausea, centrally acting \u2013 risk of withdrawal Tizanidine Alpha-2 agonist sedation, dizziness, xerostomia, weakness, centrally acting \u2013 risk of withdrawal Diazepam/ Benzodiazepines GABA-A agonist sedation, confusion, hypotension, centrally acting \u2013 risk of withdrawal Dantrolene inhibits Ca release from sarcoplasmic reticulum weakness, sedation, nausea, hepatotoxicity, acts directly on skeletal muscle Intrathecal baclofen: Reserved for patients who have significant side effects with oral anti-spasticity medications or who have severe, persistent, and diffuse spasticity despite maximal doses. Injections Botulinum toxin: Blocks the presynaptic release of acetylcholine from motor endplates of the lower motor neuron at the myoneural junction. Effect usually lasts 3-8months Alcohol block: Phenol and ethanol are neurolytic agents that can be used to block nerves with motor function. Surgeries Selective dorsal rhizotomy, osteotomy, muscle tendon lengthening, release, or transfer ***If a patient experiences worsening of spasticity, it is important to consider other underlying conditions such as infections, pressure ulcers, constipation, or bladder distention*** Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) \u2013 Jake Dovgan and Doug Bryant Background TBI is categorized as a disruption in brain function leading to decreased consciousness, memory deficits, neurological deficits, or intracranial lesion. This disruption is a result of an external blow or force. Most common causes of TBI are falls and MVC. Falls are the most common cause of TBI in elderly population. Assessment Mechanism of injury Initial GCS Loss of consciousness and duration Other injuries Initial evaluation should include a non-contrasted head CT to rule out hemorrhage Full neuro exam including but not limited to cranial nerves, strength, cognition (orientation), memory, reflexes, sensation, cerebellar testing, range of motion of joints, Babinski, and Hoffmann's Classification Severity GCS Post-Traumatic Amnesia Loss of Consciousness Mild 13-15 \\<1 day \\<30 minutes Moderate 9-12 1 day to 7 days >30 minutes and \\<24 hours Severe 3-8 >1 week > 24 hours Evaluation and Management Secondary complications following TBI: In the acute setting, patients who have had a TBI are at risk for seizures, agitation, autonomic problems, bowel/bladder, wounds, vertigo, headaches, and cognitive impairment, venous thrombosis, and spasticity If concerned about TBI would consult PM&R and Speech Therapy for assistance in management of complications and assessment of cognition. If concerned for spasticity refer to \u201cSpasticity section\u201d for specific medication recommendations.

Increased frequency in diabetics AC (acromioclavicular) joint pain: joint often affected by OA, RA and common cause for anterior shoulder pain shoulder separations and osteoarthritis Glenohumeral OA: degeneration of articular cartilage and subchondral bone with narrowing of the glenohumeral joint. Presents in older adults with progressively worsening anterior shoulder pain and stiffness in both passive and active ROM Biceps Tendinopathy: localized anterior shoulder pain, worsened with overhead lifting; when rupture develops, will often have a \u201clump\u201d and acute worsening of symptoms Posterior shoulder pain often related to cervical radiculopathy Evaluation Physical Exam: Inspection: Symmetry, erythema, ecchymosis, swelling, deformity, muscle atrophy (deltoid, infraspinatus), scapular winging Palpation: warmth, landmarks, tenderness: SC joint, clavicle, AC joint, acromion, spine of scapula, bicipital groove, biceps tendon, greater tuberosity of humerus, common myofascial trigger points (trapezius, levator scapulae, rhomboids, supraspinatus) Passive ROM: performed by the examiner without patient assistance Helps to distinguish motion limitations caused by a structural constraint (adhesive capsulitis) vs. motion limitations caused by pain Active ROM: performed by the pt on their own. Loss of active motion usually indicates weakness due to either muscular (tears) or nerve injury C-spine: evaluate the C-spine as the origin of pain that may be referred to the shoulder Provocation tests: see Below Imaging: Not as useful as a thorough physical exam, especially if non-traumatic pain XR: AP (Internal Rotation, External Rotation), Lateral, Scapular and axillary views CT: often reserved for traumatic fracture and artificial joint assessment MRI w/out contrast: used to evaluate soft tissues, tendons, muscle and bursae Ultrasound: becoming more useful for initial evaluation of rotator cuff Test Isolates Action Positive if Empty Can Test Supraspinatus Place arms at 80\u2070 abduction, 30\u2070 forward flexion and pronate hand with thumbs down; exert downward force at elbows Pain tendinopathy Weakness + pain tear Neer sign Subacromial impingement Passively flex arm with hand pronated (similar to empty can) If pain subacromial impingement External Rotation Infraspinatus, teres minor Arms at side, flex 90\u2070 elbow, exert medial force to distal forearm Weakness, pain Lag sign & Lift-Off test Subscapularis Place dorsum of hand on lumbar area of back and actively and passively move hand off of back Pain or failure to perform indicates subscapularis pathology Cross arm test AC joint Active abduction of arm across torso Pain AC joint dysfunction Speed\u2019s Test Biceps Tendon Have pt extend arm in full supination with the shoulder flexed.

Can be law enforcement officers, psychologists, physicians Must document justification for why the hold is needed (progress note, assessment form, etc) \"6404\": 6404= Certificate of Need. Legal document used for emergency involuntary psychiatric admission Pt must have mental illness or serious emotional disturbance (excluding intellectual/developmental disabilities) and pose an immediate substantial likelihood of serious harm because of this based on a face-to face assessment by a qualified psychiatric professional Treatment must be necessary for symptom reduction and lack of treatment would lead to deterioration, with no less drastic alternative to inpatient hospitalization Two certificates needed: the first to transport a patient to a psychiatric facility and the second for an involuntary admission Two different qualified persons must each complete a form Psychiatry residents can write these due to their special training licenses No AMA Medical Hold: used when a patient does not have capacity to leave the hospital against medical advice due to a medical condition and needs to remain in the hospital Can be ordered by any physician Medical Hold Order Set VUH specific procedures A physical copy of the first 6404 is required to accompany the patient when they are transported to a psychiatric facility after medical discharge. The form is completed by the psychiatry team Inpatient Insomnia \u2013 Julian Raffoul, Jose Alberto Arriola Vigo Background Sleep disturbances in the hospital are multifactorial Consequences of sleep disturbances include changes in cognition, behavior, anxiety, pain perception, respiratory function, inflammation, and metabolism Goals while inpatient: optimize sleep environment, minimize stimulating or sleep-related side effects of concomitant medications, utilize non-pharmacologic strategies Management Non-pharmacologic interventions: Noise reduction: (ear protection, white noise, etc.) Keeps lights on during the day and off at night Reducing nighttime interruptions: Retime VS checks and lab draws Minimize devices (ex: telemetry) and lines as able Pharmacotherapy: Minimize medications such as sedatives/hypnotics, opioids, glucocorticoids, beta blockers, and certain antibiotics that disturb sleep architecture Melatonin: 1-5 mg PO qhs First-line choice based on mild side-effect profile, low potential for drug-drug interactions, and improves circadian rhythms; Dose 2-3hrs before bedtime Trazodone: 25-50 mg PO qhs (max 200 mg/day) Side effects: headache, dry mouth, and nausea Monitor for orthostasis and infrequent atrial arrhythmias; use lowest effective dose Mirtazapine: 7.5-15 mg PO qHS A primary alpha-2 antagonist with 5-HT2 and H1 antagonism Consider when insomnia appears to be related to primary depression Can increase appetite and cause weight gain Additional Information Avoid the following in the inpatient setting: Benzodiazepines Reduces sleep latency and increases total sleep time but avoided due to significant adverse effects: respiratory depression, cognitive decline, delirium, daytime sleepiness, and falls, particularly in hospitalized older adults Non-benzodiazepines benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g., zolpidem, eszopiclone/zopiclone, zaleplon) Commonly used in the outpatient setting but associated with cognitive dysfunction, delirium, and falls in hospitalized patients Diphenhydramine Trials evaluating their effectiveness as sleep aids are limited and show mixed results Many potential side effects that are enhanced in the inpatient setting: impaired cognition, anticholinergic effects (constipation, urinary retention) Substance Use Disorder (SUD) \u2013 Barrington Hwang, Kristopher Kast Background SUDs are common, complex, and chronic neuropsychiatric disorders with well-described inherited risk, dysregulated neurophysiology, and multiple effective treatment modalities Pts w/SUD face significant stigma, prior traumatic experiences in healthcare environments Using the term \u201cabuse\u201d undermines the disease model of addiction Person-centered, specific terminology: \u201cperson with opioid and alcohol use disorders\u201d Avoid the qualifier \u201cPolysubstance.\u201d Instead, clarify specific diagnoses for each substance category DSM 5 Criteria (same for most substance categories): Requires 2+ criteria met in past year; use must cause clinically significant impairment and/or distress: Loss of control \u2013 larger amounts, longer time, ongoing use despite consequences, efforts/desire to reduce use Physiologic changes -- tolerance, withdrawal (these 2 alone do not necessarily imply a disorder if they result from prescribed therapy), craving Consequences \u2013 hazardous use, interpersonal problems, medical problems, failed role obligations, lost activities General Management: First priority in the inpatient medical setting is to identify and stabilize withdrawal states Mitigate risks of severe sequelae (seizure, delirium) Avoid unintended iatrogenic harm (ex: opioid abstinence leading to lost tolerance and post-discharge overdose) Avoid distress-driven AMA discharge Consider Addiction Psychiatry consultation for management of complex withdrawal states, substance use disorders and co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses, assistance with risk stratification for hospital misuse and/or hospital discharge with PICC lines for outpatient antibiotics, and differentiation of pain requiring opioid therapy and opioid use disorder If in the emergency room and not admitted, consult PAS Opioid Use Disorder \u2013 Rita Hurd, David Marcovitz Background Standard of care is opioid stabilization with buprenorphine or methadone (in OUD) or other full agonist opioids (in chronic opioid therapy) Methadone and buprenorphine can be ordered by any physician for inpatients Maintenance agonist therapy should be offered to every patient, with preference for an \u201copt-out\u201d approach (even for uninsured patients through state grant funding) Presentation (Withdrawal) Restlessness/psychomotor activation, anxiety, irritability, nausea, abdominal cramping, loose stool, diffuse musculoskeletal pain, chills, insomnia, yawning Pupillary dilation, piloerection, tearing, nasal congestion, diaphoresis, restless legs Evaluation Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS): quantifies severity of opioid withdrawal and allows for safer buprenorphine inductions Asking about opioid exposure: \u201cYou\u2019re uncomfortable. I work with a lot of people in the hospital, and some come with regular exposure to opioids from a lot of different places (their doctors, friends), should we be treating any withdrawal for you?\u201d Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) Buprenorphine Partial agonist at the mu opioid receptor with high binding affinity Long half-life (24-36 hours) allows for daily dosing TID dosing is more effective for acute pain (as the analgesic effect is shorter-lived) OK to use in renal failure/HD; may reduce dose in hepatic injury All non-pregnant pts should receive buprenorphine-naloxone (e.g. Suboxone) formulations to mitigate risk of diversion/injection Induction: Hold all opioid medication 12+ hours prior to first buprenorphine dose (typically, this opioid-free period is overnight from 9 PM to 9 AM), with a recorded COWS score >8-10; 4 mg is given SL, monitoring for oversedation; additional 4 mg is given in 1 hour, and final 4 mg at 4 hours (total of 12 mg in first day) Only sedation or hypopnea should prevent a full 12 mg dose Typical starting dose: 12-16 mg/day Maintenance: 4-32 mg daily; 16mg and above to suppress opioid use Requires waivered-provider Acute Pain Management in pts using Buprenorphine: There is no contraindication to full-agonist opioid analgesia for breakthrough pain If the etiology of pts pain would require opioid therapy in a non-OUD patient, do not avoid opioids; these may be used safely in the hospital Peri-operative pain management: continue buprenorphine at reduced and split doses (4 mg BID or TID); will prevent withdrawal and cravings, but NOT manage new pain Post-operatively: reduce opioid requirements and increase buprenorphine to home dose If buprenorphine was discontinued, will require induction procedure Methadone Full mu opioid agonist with additional NMDA-receptor activity Better option for individuals who cannot tolerate the buprenorphine induction procedure, with significant chronic or escalating pain Long t\u00bd: 12-36 hrs; max 10 mg/d q7d, to prevent dose-stacking and delayed overdose Safe in renal failure; dose reduction for hepatic injury Potential for QT prolongation at higher doses, warrants QTc monitoring Induction: In the hospital, start at 10 mg TID, holding doses for sedation or hypopnea; lower doses if concerned for respiratory compromise or concurrent CNS depressant therapy Limit 40 mg in first 24 hours; then titrate 5 mg/d q3d while admitted Maintenance: Must confirm dose with methadone clinic before restarting outpatient dose; until then, do not give more than initial doses (30 mg in single dose, 40 mg in first 24 hours) After confirming home dose, continue as single daily dose Naltrexone Mu opioid antagonist; Half-life oral ~4 hours but clinically active ~24 hrs IM maintains clinically effective levels up to 30 days High affinity for mu receptor --> CAN precipitate withdrawal requiring 7-10 days opioid abstinence prior to initiation If due for monthly injection while admitted, may substitute oral formulation until discharged to outpatient provider to receive injection Additional Information Psychosocial Interventions that complement MOUD: Consider referral to SUD counseling, mutual help (self-help, 12-step, AA), intensive outpatient, and short- or long-term residential treatment Use of other drugs NOT a contraindication to MOUD, however should encourage abstinence from other drugs during therapy (especially benzodiazepines) Prescribe intranasal naloxone for overdose prevention to all OUD patients discharging from hospital, regardless of MOUD status Alcohol Use Disorder \u2013 Barrington Hwang, Kristopher Kast Background 50% of hospitalized pts drink alcohol; at-risk alcohol use is >14 drinks/week or >5 drinks in a sitting (for men; for women and men >65, 7 per week, >4 per sitting) Alcohol withdrawal onset occurs 6-12 hours after last drink, with 90% having non-severe course; CIWA score \\<10 at 24-48 hours indicates low risk of worsening symptoms Risk of seizures greatest at 12-24 hrs, occurring in ~3% of pts; risk of delirium greatest at 48-72 hrs, occurring in ~5% Risk assessment RF: prior seizures/delirium, co-substance use (especially benzodiazepines), no abstinent days in past month, presenting BAL >200, dysautonomia CIWA symptom-triggered protocol appropriate for pts at low risk of severe withdrawal For non-low risk pts, consider benzodiazepine/barbiturate load and standing taper; Indications for admission: prior severe withdrawal (withdrawal seizures or delirium), comorbidities (medical and psychiatric illness), pregnancy, significant impairment in social/occupational functioning, communication barriers, social barriers Presentation Acute intoxication: disinhibition, slurred speech, ataxia, nystagmus Acute Withdrawal: nausea, vomiting, anxiety, agitation, audio-visual and tactile hallucinations, headache, diaphoresis, fine motor tremor while arms and fingers outstretched, autonomic hyperactivity Chronic heavy use: Sequelae of chronic liver disease & malnutrition, including thiamine deficiency Caine criteria for Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy: 2 or more: (1) malnutrition, (2) ataxia, (3) oculomotor abnormalities, (4) AMS Evaluation Identify last use, quantity per day/week, other sedative-hypnotic use, history of withdrawal, social/occupational dysfunction, other toxic forms of alcohol compounds including methanol, ethylene glycol Acute Alcohol Withdrawal Labs: Blood alcohol level, urine toxicology (\u00b1 ethyl glucuronide to detect use in prior 3 days), BMP, CBC, HFTs (AST:ALT elevation 2:1), CK and \u03b2 - hCG CIWA score quantifies severity, though subject to inflation by subjective symptoms Management Acute Alcohol Withdrawal Most patients are appropriate for diazepam-based protocols: CIWA-based symptom-triggered for low-risk patients Diazepam load + standing taper for non-low risk patients Substitute lorazepam for pts with hepatic impairment (risk of long-acting accumulation) Benzodiazepine resistance: likely due to poor cross-tolerance, these pts require phenobarbital load ( 8-12 mg/kg (up to 15 mg/kg) divided into 3 doses 3 hours apart) Add folate, multivitamin, and electrolyte repletion If >2 Caine criteria, treat empirically for Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy with high-dose IV thiamine (500 mg TID IV x 3-5 days) Consider Addiction Psychiatry consultation for complex presentations Alcohol Use Disorder After withdrawal stabilization, engage pt in discussion around use and educate on connection between use and presenting medical problems All patients with AUD should be initiated on pharmacotherapy (MAUD) prior to discharge to mitigate risk of relapse, if consistent with patient\u2019s goals Additional psychosocial treatments effective for AUD include 12-step groups (AA, SMART Recovery), cognitive behavioral therapy, sober living facilities, family therapy, contingency management, and IOP/residential facilities If patient does not have abstinence goal, reduced or controlled drinking may allow for harm reduction; naltrexone and topiramate have evidence for non-abstinence outcomes Pharmacologic Interventions: Naltrexone (cannot be on opioid agonist): Need 7-10 days since last opioid before starting 25 mg x1 day, then titrate up to 50 mg daily; also available in q30d IM Monitor liver enzymes; AST/ALT must be \\< 3-5x ULN Acamprosate (cannot be used in severe renal impairment) Head-to-head, inferior to naltrexone (see COMBINE trial) 333 mg TID, titrating to 666 mg TID dosing Disulfiram Infrequently used outside of extreme motivation (e.g. professional under monitoring); would not use outside specialist care Must abstain from alcohol ~2 weeks after last dose, given risk of disulfiram-ethanol reaction (DER), which can be fatal depending upon disulfiram and ethanol doses Topiramate Not FDA-approved for AUD, but has significant supporting evidence Useful for individuals without abstinence goal Titrate slowly over 8 weeks to 200-300 mg/d Gabapentin Not FDA-approved for AUD, but with some evidence Useful for post-acute withdrawal anxiety, insomnia, or co-occurring neuropathy Titrate to 900-1800 mg/d divided into TID dosing, monitoring for sedation Risk of sedation/apnea if concomitant alcohol use Delirium \u2013 Julian Raffoul, reviewed by Wesley Ely and Jo Ellen Wilson Background Definition: acute fluctuating disturbance of attention and awareness due to an underlying medical condition Presentation: deficits in attention, orientation, or memory; hallucinations or delusions; sleep-wake disturbances; psychomotor changes (hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed); language impairment; and/or emotional lability (agitation) Think about the ABC\u2019s of Delirium Affect (anxiety, paranoia, irritability, apathy, mood shifts, personality changes) Behavior (hallucinations, restlessness or agitation, psychomotor abnormalities, sleep disturbances) Cognition (impaired memory, disorientation, disturbances in speech) Evaluation Use screening tools to assess for delirium: Brief Confusion Assessment Method (bCAM). See critical care section for the ICU version, CAM-ICU Once delirium is diagnosed, evaluate for the underlying cause. Delirium has many etiologies and may occur alone or in combination (in ~10% of cases, no clear cause is found) Mnemonic for common causes of delirium: D- Drugs/toxins (use of benzodiazepines, opiates, anticholinergics, steroids, etc., withdrawal from ETOH, benzos, etc.) E- Eyes/ears (sensory deficits) L- Low perfusion states (MI, PE, heart failure, sepsis) I- Infection R- Retention (urine, stool) I- Intracranial events (trauma, seizure, stroke, hemorrhage) U- Undernutrition/dehydration M- Metabolic, endocrine (Hypo or hyper Na, hyperCa, uremia, thyroid, hypoglycemia) See neurology chapter for approach and work-up to AMS in general Management Treat underlying cause as above See critical care section for prevention in the ICU (ABCDEF bundle) Cognitive impairment or disorientation: provide clock, calendar, and appropriate lighting. Regular reorientation. Provide cues from a familiar environment (pictures, calls or visits from family members) Encourage mobilization Review medications, eliminate sedatives and anticholinergics as able (review agents on Beers Criteria medication list) Remove medical support devices as able (foley catheters, telemetry) Maintain normal sleep-wake cycle. Keep lights on in the day and avoid excessive naps Ensure adequate bowel regimen and hydration Assess for pain and treat appropriately Ensure hearing aids, glasses, and dentures are available Note on pharmacologic management: There is no pharmacologic intervention known to prevent or treat of delirium.

Expected pCO2 = 0.7*(HCO3) + 20 (\u00b15) Etiologies: Associated with high aldosterone (either appropriate or inappropriate) Chloride Responsive = appropriate hyperaldosteronism, can usually be fixed with Cl administration/ volume resuscitation Etiologies: Volume contraction i.e., vomiting, over-diuresis) Urine Cl \\<20 Chloride Unresponsive = inappropriate hyperaldosteronism, cannot fix with NaCl administration/ volume resuscitation Etiologies: Steroids, Cushing\u2019s, Conn\u2019s, RAS, CHF, cirrhosis Urine Cl >20 Primary Metabolic Acidosis: See nephrology section, \u201cMetabolic Acidosis\u201d Interstitial Lung Disease \u2013 Pakinam Mekki Background Heterogenous group of parenchymal lung diseases that involve scarring or fibrosis, affecting the lung interstitium, alveoli, and pulmonary capillaries Leads to loss of lung volume and compliance and impaired gas exchange Etiologies ILD is divided into primary (idiopathic) causes and secondary causes Idiopathic: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, eosinophilic pneumonia, idiopathic NSIP, organizing pneumonia, acute interstitial pneumonia, etc Secondary Systemic: Connective tissue disease: RA, Sjogrens, dermatomyositis, polymyositis SLE, MCTD, scleroderma Granulomatous disease: sarcoidosis, TB Vasculitis: granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, amyloidosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis Exposure Pneumoconiosis (inorganic) \u2013 exposure to coal mines, silica, asbestos, organic solvents, heavy metals, solder, hair dressing chemicals Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (organic)- farm exposures, chicken coops, pesticide, stored grains, mold (ex: water damage in home, hot tubs) Iatrogenic \u2013 amiodarone, immunotherapies, TKI, TNF-a inhibitors, nitrofurantoin, radiation Evaluation Dry cough is the most common symptom of ILD. Productive coughs are uncharacteristic History: Duration, timing, severity of respiratory symptoms Exposures \u2013 pets, occupation, residence, smoking, drugs, travel, hobbies, dust, hay, grass, Screen for autoimmune symptoms (arthritis, myalgia, rash, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon Screen for vasculitis symptoms: hematuria, hemoptysis, mononeuritis multiplex Medication history Family history \u2013 premature aging, myelodysplastic syndrome (most common familial IPF association with telomerase mutations) Chest Imaging: CXR \u2013 could find peripheral reticular opacities HRCT protocol is used for diagnosis: evaluates the lung parenchyma while pt is supine, prone, with inspiratory and expiratory cuts There are two morphologic features on HRCT Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP): basilar predominant fibrosis, honey combing, and traction bronchiectasis. Minimal GGOs. Pattern seen in IPF. Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP): Marked by subpleural sparing, increased reticular patterns, and mosaic attenuation due to air trapping. Minimal or absent honeycombing Labs Rule out infection: CBC, RVP, sputum Cx, Histo antigen, Blasto antigen, Aspergillus galactomannan, 1,3-\u03b2-D-Glucan, sputum GMS, consider NTM, HIV Rheumatologic workup: ANA w/ reflex ENA, ESR, CRP, CK, aldolase, consider full myositis panel, RF, anti-CCP Bronchoscopy BAL is not diagnostic ILD (except eosinophilic PNA), may be helpful to rule out infection Transbronchial biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis. Surgical lung biopsy may be helpful in cases where the clinical evaluation and imaging are not effective (uncommon) Misc: PFTs with 6-minute walk test (prognostic value) TTE to evaluate for pHTN SLP evaluation for indolent aspiration Management Acute flare \u2013 all non- UIP = may respond to steroids. Consult rheumatology if CTD origin for further options. Chronic therapy Consider tyrosine kinase inhibitor (nintedanib; INPULSIS trial) and antifibrotics (pirfenidone; ASCEND trial) \u2013 reduces FVC decline but no change in mortality There is increased mortality in IPF with azathioprine/pred/NAC (PANTHER-IPF); steroids are not indicated Immunosuppression for autoimmune related ILD Antigen avoidance for hypersensitivity pneumonitis Consider lung transplant evaluation for severe disease Acute Asthma Exacerbation \u2013 Stacy Blank Presentation History of asthma or a history concerning for asthma Progressive worsening of symptoms: dyspnea, chest tightness, wheezing, and cough Physical exam with wheezing, poor air movement, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, hypoxemia Often use of peak flows is cited in the literature (PEF \\<200 L/min or PEF \\<50% predicted indicates severe obstruction, PEF \\<70% predicted indicates moderate exacerbation) May be useful although often does not change management acutely Evaluation Generally aimed at ruling out causes for exacerbation and other diagnoses; these are not required but should be considered in pts being admitted for inpatient management: EKG, trop, BNP, D-dimer to assess for cardiac cause (ACS, CHF, PE) CXR to rule out underlying process (PNA, PTX, atelectasis) ABG/VBG not routinely needed unless ill-appearing, tachypneic, or lethargic/altered Dangerous signs and possible ICU if: Tachypnea >30 and/or significantly increased work-of-breathing Hypercapnia or even normocapnia (these pts are usually hyperventilating; a normal CO2 in a severe asthma exacerbation could indicate impending respiratory failure) Altered mental status Requiring continuous nebulizers Management Continuous pulse ox with oxygen therapy to maintain O2 >92 % Continuous albuterol nebulizer or Duonebs until able to space to q1h>>q2h, etc Steroids with dosing based on severity of illness (there is no data behind exact dosing of steroids). Start with IV methylpred 125mg q6h in severe exacerbation/ICU patients Can start with oral prednisone 60mg q12h in less severe exacerbation/floor pts Plan to transition from IV to PO and then likely to send pt home to finish course of 40-60 mg pred daily for 5-7 days. IV mag sulfate 4g over 20 minutes for severe exacerbation Keep pt NPO until off continuous nebs/respiratory effort is improved. Consider IV fluids with pt\u2019s comorbidities (HFrEF, renal disease) vs. increased insensible losses with resp effort If pt is not responding to therapies, has worsening respiratory status, or blood gas concerning for respiratory acidosis needs ICU care for BiPAP vs mechanical ventilation Note: We do not start empiric antibiotics unless there is concern for bacterial infection Prior to discharge: Ensure that pt is on appropriate controller medications (see outpatient management) Evaluate for causes of acute exacerbation to prevent future events (noncompliance, resp viruses, allergies, exposures, etc.) COPD Exacerbation \u2013 Taylor Coston Background Presentation: increased dyspnea, cough, and sputum production or purulence, diffuse wheezing, distant breath sounds, tachypnea, tachycardia Severe respiratory insufficiency: accessory muscle use, fragmented speech, inability to lie supine, profound diaphoresis, agitation, asynchrony between chest and abdominal wall with respiration, failure to improve with initial emergency treatment Impending respiratory arrest: Inability to maintain respiratory effort, cyanosis, hemodynamic instability, and depressed mental status Remember that patients with COPD can have other causes of respiratory distress including acute coronary syndrome, decompensated heart failure, PE, PNA, PTX, sepsis, acidosis Evaluation Initial Assessment: ABCs Airway/Breathing: Ensure patient is protecting airway If obtunded or in severe respiratory distress intubation BiPAP typically appropriate for severe COPD exacerbation unless contraindication (vomiting, obtundation, facial trauma) BiPAP is ordered as IPAP and EPAP, 12/5 is often a good start Circulation For hemodynamic instability immediate rapid sequence intubation. Pt\u2019s can be hypotensive for a host of reasons (pneumothorax, sepsis, circulatory collapse from hypoxia and bradycardia, etc) Subsequent Workup: Continuous pulse oximetry, ABG/VBG, EKG, CXR, CBC, BMP, troponin, BNP, sputum cx, RPP, blood cultures if hemodynamically unstable Lung ultrasound to differentiate COPD from pulmonary edema when a pt presents with wheezing and respiratory failure (pulmonary edema will have B lines) Consider trigger: viral infection (70%), PNA, PE (have a high index of suspicion for PE) Management Bronchodilators Order \u201cRespiratory Care Therapy Management Protocol\u201d at VUMC RT evaluates the pt and based on physical exam will give a duoneb. Continues to assess the pt and treats based on severity of the exacerbation If ordering bronchodilators individually: Albuterol 2.5 mg diluted to 3 mL via nebulizer or 4 to 8 inhalations from MDI every 4 hours while awake (RT) or more frequently if needed Ipratropium 500 mcg via nebulizer, or 4-8 inhalations from MDI q4 hrs while awake Can additionally order Duoneb (albuterol and ipratroprium) q4-6 hours at VUMC There is no respiratory order protocol at the VA, order individually as above Steroids For severe exacerbation give methylprednisolone 125 mg IV BID (or 60mg IV q6h) For moderate to mild COPD exacerbations give prednisone 40mg PO daily for 5 days (including the initial IV dose if pt received one in the ER) Antibiotics For moderate to severe exacerbations Azithromycin (500mg x 1 then 250mg daily x 4 or 500mg daily x 3) or doxycycline 200 mg BID if concern for QT prolongation. Can consider respiratory fluroquinolone in certain high-risk patients but typically too broad Refer to Pneumonia in Infection Disease chapter if treating concomitant pneumonia Discharge Planning: Controller medications/inhalers (see COPD in Outpatient chapter) Make sure any new inhalers are covered by insurance prior to discharge Provide inhaler education and consider use of a spacer Vaccinations (influenza, COVID, pneumococcal) Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Exacerbation Background Presentation: acute worsening of pulmonary symptoms such as new/increased cough, sputum production (or change in sputum quality), dyspnea. May have constitutional symptoms including fatigue, poor appetite Evaluation \u201cCystic Fibrosis\u201d Admission order set in epic is useful and contains most of the work-up and management listed below Labs: Sputum culture (specify CF culture), RPP CXR PA and lateral Always ask about coughing up blood and amount -- see 'Hemoptysis' section if present Management All patients need a cystic fibrosis pulmonary consult (unless on Rogers Pulmonary if attending specializes in CF). FYI there is no fellow so don\u2019t worry when you have to page an attending All CF pts are placed on contact precautions Antibiotics Check CF notes, recent hospitalizations, culture data \u2013 MRSA, MSSA, and Pseudomonas are the most common If they were recently admitted and improved on that antibiotic regimen, it is usually a good empiric choice. CF team will ultimately guide regimen General coverage: MRSA vancomycin (Bactrim or linezolid for allergies) Pseudomonas Penicillin class (cephalosporin, carbapenem, extended penicillin) AND aminoglycoside or Ciprofloxacin (double coverage) Be aware that the antibiotic doses are not the typical doses used for other indications. Use Epic Order Adult Cystic Fibrosis order set for Antibiotic/dosing (or consult with CF team, pharmacy) Continue tobramycin nebs (if on that month) and MWF Azithromycin unless otherwise contraindicated if they are on these therapies at home Airway/sputum clearance Albuterol nebs, pulmozyme (if on at home), hypertonic saline (if on at home), Vest, positive end expiratory pressure valve (PEP, ex: Flutter, Acapella), chest percussive devices (the wand) as last choice (not as effective) CF modulators (e.g., ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elaxacaftor): continue if on at home, needs a non-formulary order so pt can use own supply; time with fat rich meal for absorption Nutrition/GI Pancreatic enzymes (most pts are on them), order at bedside for pt administration Always continue ADEK vitamins Daily to 3 times a week weight checks Nutrition consult DIOS - Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome Acute obstruction (complete or incomplete) in ileocecum by inspissated intestinal contents. Presents with abdominal pain/distension, constipation, poor appetite, possibly vomiting often looks like mechanical obstruction Treat with Miralax and/or Golytely RARELY surgery, try medical management first Pulmonary Hypertension \u2013 Pakinam Mekki Background Symptoms: insidious dyspnea, exertional chest pain, orthopnea, PND, edema Exam: JVD, increased P2, split S2, RV heave, TR murmur, hepatomegaly, ascites, edema Signs of RV failure: low cardiac output (hypotension, renal failure, hepatic congestion), arrhythmias, refractory hypoxemia (R\u2192L shunt), effusions (pericardial > pleural) WHO Groups and Causes: Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): obliteration of blood vessels in the lung Idiopathic, heritable Drugs/toxins (methamphetamine) Associated with CTD, HIV, portal HTN, congenital heart disease, schistosomiasis Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD), pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis Group 2: Left heart disease: back pressure and passive congestion HFrEF, HFpEF, valvular disease, LA stiffness Group 3: Chronic lung disease: chronic hypoxemia, chronic pulmonary vasoconstriction COPD, ILD, OSA, chronic high-altitude, developmental lung disorders Group 4: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) Group 5: Multifactorial Hematologic disorders, chronic hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, fibrosing mediastinitis, metabolic disorders Evaluation Most common reason for admission with a known diagnosis of pHTN is volume overload/RV failure and hypoxia Consider etiology of decompensation: Progression of underlying disease, medication/dietary nonadherence, infection, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction/RV ischemia, shunting via opening a PFO as a release valve, pulmonary embolism Consult pulmonary hypertension with any questions or assistance with workup Studies to consider ordering to determine etiology of pulmonary hypertension Labs: BNP, liver enzymes, rheumatologic serologies (ANA w/ reflex ENA, RF/CCP, ANCA, Scl-70, Ro/LA) EKG: R-axis deviation, RBBB, increased P wave in lead II CXR: increased PA and R heart border, vascular pruning TTE w bubble: RVSP >35-40, RV dilation and dysfunction, RA dilation, septal flattening, pericardial effusion, evaluate for L heart disease and shunt PFT (outpatient): isolated decrease in DLCO in group I PH, TLC \\< 50%, FEV/FVC \\< 70% V/Q scan or CTA chest to evaluate for CTEPH 6-minute walk test is prognostic, can be used to monitor response to therapy \u00b1 CT chest to evaluate for parenchymal lung disease \u00b1 sleep study to evaluate for OSA Right heart catheterization (RHC) is the gold standard test for PH diagnosis and determines pre-vs post-capillary HTN (See RHC section in Cardiology) Nitric oxide challenge to assess for drug response Fluid challenge with 500cc LR to assess left heart compliance ` Definitions Characteristics Causes Pre-capillary PH mPAP > 20 mmHg PAWP \u2264 15 mmHg PVR \u2265 3 WU Groups 1, 3, 4, 5 Post-capillary PH mPAP > 20 mmHg PAWP > 15 mmHg PVR < 3 WU Group 2 Combined pre- and post- capillary PH mPAP > 20 mmHg PAWP > 15 mmHg PVR \u2265 3 WU Group 2, 5 Poor Prognostic Indicators for pHTN NYHA Functional Class (FC III-IV) - 6-minute walk test \\< 300 AKI - Hyponatremia Low SBP (SBP \\< 90) - CTD or liver disease as etiology Poor hemodynamics on RHC (RAP > 20; cardiac index \\< 2) TTE findings - TAPSE \\< 1.8, pericardial effusion, severe RV dysfunction Management Goal of hospitalization is to understand and optimize hemodynamics Overall goal- improve NYHA functional class, RV function, 6-minute walk test, quality of life General management: treat underlying cause, diuretics for right heart failure, goal SpO2>90% PAH medicines: Consult pulmonary hypertension if considering starting of changing meds Oral treatments may be used as monotherapy or in combination Calcium-channel blockers \u2192 patients with + vasoreactive challenge NO-cGMP enhancers: PDE5-inhibitors sildenafil or tadalafil, riociguat Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs): Bosentan, macitenatan, ambrisentan \u2013 Prostacyclin analogs Prostacyclin analogs increase cAMP-mediated pulmonary vasodilation. Side effects include jaw pain, flushing, arthralgia, diarrhea. IV formulations are administered through a continuous pump. Never stop IV prostacyclins, even brief pauses can cause rebound vasoconstriction and death. In an emergency, can run temporarily through PIV Epoprostenol: IV (Veletri) or inhaled (Flolan), half-life 4 minutes. Treprostinil: IV/subcutaneous/inhaled/PO, half-life 4 hours Iloprost: inhaled, half-life minutes Selexipag (Uptravi): PO, half-life hours Treatment based on NYHA functional classification: Class I: no treatment or monotherapy Class II: monotherapy or combination oral therapy Class III: combination oral therapy or prostacyclin Class IV: prostacyclin \u00b1 oral therapy Lung transplant for patients who are candidates and failing maximal medical therapy VA ECMO can be used as bridge to medical therapy or lung transplant Atrial septostomy- serves as \u201cpop-off\u201d valve and allows for decompression of failing RV; used as definitive palliative procedure or bridge to transplant Hemoptysis \u2013 Henry Brems Background Distinguish between massive (>600cc/24hr or >100cc/hr) and non-massive hemoptysis. Can be difficult to quantify expectorated blood volume and volume that is retained in lungs Massive is potentially life-threatening due to impaired ventilation Remember UGIB (hematemesis) and nasopharyngeal bleeds can easily mimic hemoptysis Presentation based on source of bleed: Structure Etiologies Airways Bronchitis (common cause of non-massive), bronchiectasis (especially in CF pts), neoplasm Alveolar/ Parenchymal Infectious (bacterial PNA, abscess, TB, fungal, aspergilloma), Rheumatic (Goodpasture\u2019s, GPA, Behcet\u2019s) Vascular PE, AVM, CHF, mitral stenosis Other Coagulopathy, traumatic, foreign-body, iatrogenic, cocaine-induced Evaluation Check for anticoagulation on med list Labs: CBC, BMP, Coags, UA (for hematuria), ABG (evaluate oxygenation), type and screen Consider ANA, ANCA, Anti-GBM, sputum culture (bacteria, fungal, AFB), sputum cytology depending on clinical context Imaging: CXR first (to evaluate etiology and to localize the source to a side). Chest CT depending on prior workup, severity of bleed, and stability of patient Bronchoscopy is sometimes indicated to localize bleeding source Management Urgent evaluation if any hemodynamic compromise, hypoxia, hypercarbia, or respiratory distress Ensure a secure airway: massive hemoptysis may require intubation and MICU transfer Reverse underlying coagulopathy if present. Consider trending HCT If unilateral bleed, place bleeding lung down (i.e. if the source is left lung, place pt on left side) to prevent filling 'good' lung with blood (include this info in sign-out if known) Urgent pulmonary consult if clinical instability: Bronchoscopy is diagnostic and therapeutic Obtain CT Bronchial Artery Protocol if concern for bronchial artery source (especially in CF patients) so embolization can be planned Order this at VUMC with a CTA Chest (NOT a CTA PE as that will be timed incorrectly) and include \"bronchial artery protocol\" in comments for the study Consider IR consult for angiography as diagnostic and therapeutic option Consult early if there is massive hemoptysis; If bronchoscopy is attempted but fails to stop the bleed, they can get to angiography fastest if IR has already been made aware Pleural Effusions \u2013 Eddie Qian Background There is a normal influx of fluid into the pleural space due to leaky capillary membranes and the pleural space\u2019s negative pressure. This fluid is constantly reabsorbed by lymphatics. An imbalance in the system will result in accumulation. Some examples: Increased influx: increased filtration from the capillaries from high intravascular hydrostatic pressure (i.e., heart failure, renal failure) or low intravascular oncotic pressure Other liquid entry into the pleural space through anatomic deficits: CSF, chyle, urine, blood, ascites (the diaphragm is naturally porous) Decreased efflux: obstruction of the parietal pleural stoma (from protein or cellular debris in exudative pleural effusions) Increased systemic venous pressure (lymphatic system drains into the systemic venous circulation so high venous pressure prevents lymphatics from draining appropriately) Evaluation Imaging: CXR: lateral decubitus position (if effusion moves with gravity, suggests free flowing) Ultrasound: assess size, location, loculations CT Chest with contrast (not always indicated; helpful to eval septations) Thoracentesis (see Procedures section): Will it change management? Pleural LDH, protein, cell count/diff, culture (don\u2019t forget to order serum LDH & protein) Consider: pleural cytology, hematocrit, triglycerides, glucose, amylase If septated or empyema, consider pulm consult for chest tube Interpretation of pleural studies: Lights criteria: 1 of the following to be considered an exudative effusion Pleural to serum protein ratio > 0.5 Pleural to serum LDH ratio > 0.6 Pleural LDH > \u2154 upper limit of normal range of serum LDH Transudative: CHF exacerbation, hepatic hydrothorax, atelectasis (caused by increased intrapleural negative pressure), hypoalbuminemia, renal failure Exudative: infections (bacterial, TB, fungal), malignant, rheumatologic, PE Other tips: Protein: >5 think TB or malignancy, \\< 0.5 think urine, CSF, peritoneal dialysate Glucose: \\< 60 think about malignancy, TB, or rheumatologic, less likely hemothorax or parapneumonic Cell count/differential: polys represent an acute process, monocytes represent a chronic process, lymphocytes think about TB or malignancy, eosinophils think about air/blood, TB, malignancy, asbestos, drugs Two separate processes may co-occur, and a transudate may mask an exudative effusion; if concerned for this and you have clinical stability, trial diuresis prior to thoracentesis Lung Masses \u2013 Chandler Montgomery Background Definitions: lesion \\< 3 cm = pulmonary nodule. Lesion > 3 cm = lung mass Pulmonary nodules are common and often benign, but presence of lung mass (>3cm) should prompt workup as chance of malignancy is high (>50%) For nodules, refer to the Fleischner Society guidelines (incidental nodules) or Lung-RADS (detected on lung cancer screening) for surveillance/management recommendations Note that in TN, prior histoplasmosis is a very common cause of pulmonary nodules Differential diagnosis: Malignant: Primary non-small cell lung cancer (NCSLC): adenocarcinoma, squamous cell (SCC), large cell carcinoma Metastatic: commonly melanoma, sarcoma, colon, breast, renal, testicular Often multiple nodules/masses (e.g., cannonball) Neuroendocrine: small cell lung cancer (SCLC), carcinoid, large cell neuroendocrine Infectious: Granulomatous: TB, non-TB mycobacterium, endemic fungal (histo, blasto, coccidio) May have component of calcification Abscess: Staph aureus, Klebsiella, anaerobes, polymicrobial (aspiration) Septic emboli, hydatid cyst, aspergilloma Other: hamartoma, AVM, pulmonary infarct, inflammatory nodule (GPA, RA), sarcoidosis Evaluation History: smoking, cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest pain, weight loss, fevers, night sweats, hoarseness, bone pain, neuro deficits Lung cancer should always be considered in a patient with smoking history & new cough or hemoptysis Exam: cachexia, lymphadenopathy, bone pain, hepatomegaly, neuro deficits Imaging: CXR has poor sensitivity for lung nodules, may show large mass or malignant effusion CT chest (with contrast if possible - better evaluation of mediastinum/LNs) Review prior chest imaging to assess age and growth pattern of lesion(s) Benign features: small (sub-centimeter), calcified, fat attenuation, stable over 2 years, multiple nodules Concerning features: large, growth, spiculation, upper lobe location, thick-walled cavitation, mediastinal invasion Location- adenocarcinoma often more peripheral, SCC often more central, SCLC associated with massive LAD, mediastinal invasion, large hilar masses Look for paraneoplastic syndromes: SCLC: SIADH, Lambert-Eaton, Cushing\u2019s syndrome SCC: hypercalcemia (PTHrP) Dermatomyositis, polymyositis, hypertrophic osteoarthropathy Staging/Diagnosis Imaging: CT chest (with contrast if possible)m CTAP w/contrast vs. PET/CT to assess for metastasis, consider MRI brain if clinical stage III or IV disease Biopsy: careful planning is key For metastatic disease, obtain tissue from least invasive site FNA or excision of palpable lymph node (cytology department, US-guided procedure, or EGS) If uncertain how to best obtain tissue, consult IR, interventional pulm, and/or oncology to discuss approach Surgical Bx: Wedge resection/lobectomy often preferred if solitary nodule amenable to both diagnostic and therapeutic resection in good surgical candidate Bronchoscopy with EBUS (endobronchial US) often used to obtain biopsy of mediastinal tissue or central/peri-bronchial lesion Trans-thoracic needle aspiration (TTNA): peripheral lesions not amenable to bronchoscopy Management Planning is complex, usually discussed at multidisciplinary tumor board NSCLC Stage I/II: surgical resection \u00b1 adjuvant chemotherapy Stage III: more complex requiring multidisciplinary approach Stage IV: chemo \u00b1 targeted therapy depending on PD-L1 expression, presence of driver mutations for EGFR, ALK, ROS-1, BRAF, MET, RET, others SCLC: usually widely metastatic at time of diagnosis, treated with systemic chemo/radiation Inhaler Therapy \u2013 Patrick Barney Inhaler therapy Current inhaler device delivery options MDI \u2013 typical handheld inhaler Pro is same dose of medicine each time you use them \u2013 if used correctly. Con is that it requires coordination. Patient must be able to time 3-5s slow inhalation and 5-10s breath hold w/ release of medicine, can be helped w/ spacer. SMI \u2013 \u201csoft mist inhaler,\u201d handheld. Creates cloud of medicine that is inhaled without propellant. Pros are more medicine gets into lungs than w/ MDI so lower dose can be used, does not require coordination. DPI - handheld inhaler, delivers medicine whenever patient breathes in through the device, requiring less coordination. Pro is lack of need to coordinate breath; Con is inconsistent dose delivery. Nebulizers Saline Hypertonic saline, NS, 3% and 7%. Can be used to thin secretions and produce deep cough in patients who need to expectorate as part of treatment. For CF, chronic tracheostomy, NM weakness. No evidence for benefit in COPD.

Ex: albuterol, levalbuterol Long-acting beta agonist (LABA): - beta-2 agonists, same as SABAs but have lipophilic side chains that allow longer binding but also slow the onset of action. Ex: formoterol, salmeterol, olodaterol Long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA): - non-specific muscarinic receptor antagonists, leads to bronchodilation and reduced secretions. Ex: tiotropium, umeclidinium, glycopyrrolate Inahled corticosteroid (ICS): - suppress airway inflammation. Ex: budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone VUMC Inpatient Options SABA : Albuterol (Proventil/Ventolin/Proair) - MDI, neb, continuous aerosol available SABA/SAMA: Ipratropium-albuterol (Duo-Neb) - neb and continuous neb available LABA \u2013 only available in combination w/ ICS. LABA/ICS: vilanterol-fluticasone (Breo Ellipta), salmeterol-fluticasone (Advair Diskus/HFA) LAMA: Tiotropium (Spiriva Respimat) ICS: Budesonide inhaler (Pulmicort) or neb, fluticasone furoate (Arnuity Ellipta) Airway Clearance Therapy \u2013 Patrick Barney Indications Cystic fibrosis, advanced COPD, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, chronic neuromuscular weakness, prolonged ventilator-dependence Goal is to assist patients with removing/expectorating mucus from lungs to decrease risk of atelectasis, mucus plug, increased airway resistance, infection Chest Physiotherapy (CPT) Use: pathologies w/ retained secretions and mucous plugging (CF, bronchiectasis) RT helps patient go through sequence of positions aimed at \u201cdraining\u201d each of the lobes of the lung by gravity. Sometimes combined with percussion. Finding in Epic: chest physiotherapy > CPPD panel \u2013 will initiate RT bronchial hygiene protocol and order TID CPT High Frequency Chest Wall Compression (HFCWC) Use: pathologies w/ retained secretions (CF, bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis) or mucociliary clearance problems (lung transplant) RT wraps patient in inflatable vest, compressor rapidly inflates and deflates vest to \u201cbreak up\u201d thickened mucus from airway wall so it can be suctioned or expectorated Finding in Epic: vest > Facility List > vest physiotherapy or vest physiotherapy for CF under Procedures Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP) Use: pathologies w/ retained secretions as discussed above Patient exhales against fixed or fluttering resistor that allows air to get behind mucus, helps move mucus from airway walls, and holds airways open longer for improved ventilation Trade names- Flutter, Acapella, AerobikA Finding in Epic: PEP > Facility List > PEP therapy panel or Oscillatory PEP therapy panel under Order Sets Can also find in a supply closet on 8S and bring to patient, be sure to teach them how to use it Cough Assist Use: most effective in patients with neuromuscular weakness affecting diaphragmatic strength \u2013 muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, spinal cord lesions, SMA Via mask or trach/vent connection \u2013 applies positive pressure to fill the lungs, then quickly switches to negative pressure to produce a high expiratory flow rate to simulate a cough that is intended to produce expectorant Finding in Epic: cough assist > Facility List > cough assist treatment panel under Order Sets Chest Tubes \u2013 Pakinam Mekki Background Nomenclature: Small bore chest tubes= Pigtail Catheters (Often 8-12 Fr) placed via Seldinger technique. \u201cChest Tube\u201d technically denotes a large bore, surgical thoracostomy tube (Often 24-40 Fr) Indications: Pneumothorax, hemothorax (more often surgical chest tubes), empyema, malignant effusion (patient specific), chylothorax, penetrating chest trauma Contraindications: No absolute contraindications. Relative contraindications include hepatic hydrothorax, large emphysematous blebs, and anticoagulation or coagulopathy Procedure Consult pulmonology for patients who may need pigtail chest tube Placement and Sizing The location and size of the chest tube is related to the pathology Pneumothorax anterior near the apex of the lung in the 2 nd intercostal space, midaxillary line Fluid (water, pus, blood), posterior near the base of the lung (fifth or sixth intercostal space, midaxillary line Hemothorax surgical chest tube is placed to prevent clot formation Potential complications: Laceration of an intercostal vessel, organ perforation (lung, heart, diaphragm, intraabdominal), trauma of the intercostal neurovascular bundle, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, infection, re-expansion pulmonary edema. Smaller size results in less tissue disruption but more likely to clog or kink Understanding the Atrium: After the chest tube is placed, it is connected to the Atrium which can be connected to the wall for suction. (See Diagram below) (A) Dry suction control- determines the level of suction out of the chest tube and is set by the provider. It is important to note that while the atrium is linked to the wall suction via suction port (F) the level of wall suction is determined by (A) (B) Water seal chamber- if the atrium is disconnected from the wall suction, it is on \u201cwater seal\u201d (i.e., to gravity). This allows for the one-way flow of pleural space contents out of the chest. (C) Air leak monitor- if air bubbles are present in the water seal chamber, then that indicates the presence of air in the pleural space. The presence of air is different from normal \u201ctidaling,\u201d within the water seal and requires troubleshooting (see below). Tidaling is normal; it is the movement with respiratory variation in water seal chamber. The water should rise with inspiration and fall with expiration. (D) Collection chamber- drains the pleural fluid contents via the chest tube. (E) Suction verification window - will be orange if suction is on and atrium is functioning appropriately Troubleshooting Air leaks: If bubbles are present in the water seal chamber, this indicates air in the pleural space. This is an expected finding in a pneumothorax; over time, the air leak should disappear as the lung re-expands. This contrasts with normal tidaling present with respiratory variation There are two major causes of air leaks: Persistent air in the pleural space, seen in alveolar-pleural fistula or pneumothorax (new or old) Leak in the chest tubing at its insertion site or in the tubing system. To identify the etiology of a new air leak, try clamping the chest tube at various points, obtain a CXR Clogging: Would see debris in the collection chamber and lack of tidaling in the water seal camber In patients with viscous fluid output (ex- empyema), important to flush the chest tube with normal saline flushes at least twice daily to prevent clogging For clog- try flushing 10cc of sterile saline toward the pt or \u201cstripping\u201d the chest tube by pressing the chest tube with your fingers and pulling towards the drainage system. May require tPA or dornase for fibrinolysis, discuss with team that placed the tube Chest tube removal Generally, chest tubes are removed when there is \\< 150cc of drainage in 24 hrs (if placed for pleural effusion) For pneumothorax, there is typically a step-wise approach to removal. The team that placed the chest tube will guide removal Suctionwater seal \u00b1 clamp trial. CXR obtain after each transition to monitor for reaccumulation Chest tube should be removed while patient hums (to prevent inhalation during removal that could introduce air into pleural space).

Consider using a head saturation monitor VA Specific Guidance: Will need to document ambulatory saturations in notes as above. Call the Oxygen Clinic (number listed in all team rooms) and talk with your case manager Summary of Medicare Part C Guidelines for Home Respiratory Assist Devices i.e. CPAP/BiPAP: Restrictive thoracic disorders, covered if the following criteria are met: Documentation of a neuromuscular disease/severe thoracic cage abnormality AND one of the following: PaCO2 \u2265 45mmHg on ABG, performed while awake and on home O2 requirement Sleep oximetry demonstrates oxygen saturation \u2264 88% for \u2265 5 minutes of nocturnal recording time performed while on home O2 requirement For a neuromuscular disease (only), either: Maximal inspiratory pressure \\< 60cm H2O or forced vital capacity \\< 50% predicted and COPD may not contribute significantly Severe COPD, covered if the following criteria are met: PaCO2 \u2265 52mmHg on ABG, performed while awake and on patient\u2019s prescribed home O2 Sleep oximetry demonstrates oxygen saturation \u2264 88% for \u2265 5 minutes of nocturnal recording time, performed while breathing oxygen at 2LPM or patient\u2019s prescribed FiO2 (whichever is higher). Also requires that OSA had been considered and ruled out (formal sleep testing not required) Hypoventilation Syndrome: covered if criteria 1, 2, AND either 3 or 4 are met: PaCO2 \u226545 mm Hg on ABG, performed while awake and on home O2 requirement, AND Spirometry shows an FEV1/FVC \u2265 70% AND ABG PaCO2, performed during sleep or immediately upon awakening that demonstrates worsening PaCO2 of \u2265 7mm Hg compared to the original result in criterion 1 OR A facility-based PSG or HST demonstrates oxygen saturation \u2264 88% for \u2265 5 minutes of nocturnal recording time that is not caused by obstructive upper airway events OSA: An initial screening for OSA in the hospital is nocturnal pulse oximetry. The distinct \u201csaw-tooth\u201d pattern representing intermittent hypoxia is suggestive of OSA, and a formal NPSG or home sleep test is recommended to evaluate for OSA.

If obtunded or in severe respiratory distress (see above) call anesthesia early for consideration of endotracheal intubation. (If in the MICU during the day, just call the MICU fellow) Noninvasive ventilation (NIV), particularly BiPAP: Appropriate for most patients with severe COPD exacerbation unless immediate intubation is needed or other contraindication (vomiting, too obtunded to take off mask if necessary, facial trauma). Necessitates MICU admission Remember: BiPAP is ordered as IPAP and EPAP. I.e. if the pt is on 12/5 the mask will deliver a pressure of 12 when breathing in and 5 when breathing out. 12/5 is a good start, in comments write \u201cauto-titrate\u201d and the RT will have some leeway to change settings Immediate pharmacotherapy, in tandem with diagnostics and airway mgmt Circulation For hemodynamic instability, HR \\< 50, call anesthesia for immediate rapid sequence intubation (RSI). Pt\u2019s can be hypotensive for a host of reasons including pneumothorax, sepsis, circulatory collapse from hypoxia and bradycardia, etc. Subsequent Workup: Continuous pulse oximetry, ABG/VBG, EKG, CXR, CBC, BMP, troponin, BNP (if considering HF dx), Sputum cx, consider blood cx if concern for sepsis, rapid flu. Lung Ultrasound to differentiate COPD from pulmonary edema when a pt presents with wheezing and respiratory failure (pulmonary edema will have Kerley B lines) During evaluation, consider triggers for COPD exacerbation: viral infection (70%), PNA, PE.

RT is available to assess if needed Steroids For severe exacerbation give methylprednisolone 125 mg IV BID (or 60mg IV q6h) For moderate to mild COPD exacerbations give prednisone 40mg PO daily for 5 days (including the initial IV dose if pt received one in the ER) Antibiotics Benefit less clear in mild to moderate exacerbations Azithromycin 500mg x 1 then 250mg daily for 4 days or doxycycline 200 mg BID if concern for QT prolongation.

Local only cases do not require patient to be NPO (see IR or CT/US procedures consult note for details). Labs required within 1 month of procedure or sooner if there is a clinical situation that can affect those lab values. Think Warfarin and INR, for example.

We recommend that these get scheduled outpatient. Place an outpatient consult to image guided procedures at time of discharge/through discharge tab in EPIC to facilitate outpatient biopsies. Drain Management Best to discuss directly with service that placed the drain (IR vs. CT/US vs. surgery) Flush with 10 mL sterile saline q shift while inpatient (flush into drain towards the patient and then place back to gravity or accordion suction bag) If drain output decreases, either: The collection (e.g., abscess) has been drained The drain is clogged/malfunctioning/mispositioned Start with making sure there are no kinks in the drain, the 3 way is not clogged, and that the accordion drain is functioning. Next, ensure the drain flushes appropriately. What this means is: you can flush the drain with 10 ml of saline and when you place back to gravity/accordion drainage bag you get back what you flushed in. There should be no leakage around the drain at the skin at baseline or during flushing. If the drain is functioning, and there is still no output, obtain a CT w/ IV contrast to evaluate the collection and ongoing need for drainage, If the collection remains, and drain is appropriately positioned within the drain, it is likely clogged/malfunctioning. First ensure proper suction/3-way direction. If this is not the issue, you can consider instilling tPA into the catheter for 2 hours Would avoid in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation given increased risk of bleeding unless discussed with procedural service).

Local only cases do not require patient to be NPO (see IR or CT/US procedures consult note for details). Labs required within 1 month of procedure or sooner if there is a clinical situation that can affect those lab values. Think Warfarin and INR, for example. INR (\\<1.5 for most procedures) Platelets (>50K) Anticoagulation Google \u201cSIR anticoagulation guidelines 2019\u201d VUMC IR guidelines based on SIR 2019 guidelines are included at end of section Inpatient biopsies for malignancy: Inpatient biopsies are lowest priority on the CT/US procedures service given resource availability and will more than likely get bumped. We recommend that these get scheduled outpatient. Place an outpatient consult to image guided procedures at time of discharge/through discharge tab in EPIC to facilitate outpatient biopsies. Drain Management Best to discuss directly with service that placed the drain (IR vs. CT/US vs. surgery) Flush with 10 mL sterile saline q shift while inpatient (flush into drain towards the patient and then place back to gravity or accordion suction bag) If drain output decreases, either: The collection (e.g., abscess) has been drained The drain is clogged/malfunctioning/mispositioned Start with making sure there are no kinks in the drain, the 3 way is not clogged, and that the accordion drain is functioning. Next, ensure the drain flushes appropriately. What this means is: you can flush the drain with 10 ml of saline and when you place back to gravity/accordion drainage bag you get back what you flushed in. There should be no leakage around the drain at the skin at baseline or during flushing. If the drain is functioning, and there is still no output, obtain a CT w/ IV contrast to evaluate the collection and ongoing need for drainage, If the collection remains, and drain is appropriately positioned within the drain, it is likely clogged/malfunctioning. First ensure proper suction/3-way direction. If this is not the issue, you can consider instilling tPA into the catheter for 2 hours Would avoid in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation given increased risk of bleeding unless discussed with procedural service). Epic order: Alteplase (TPA) injection/infusion options Percutaneous drainage 2mg or 4mg If this doesn't improve output in 48 hours, consider repositioning drain (VIR consult)","title":"Consults for Radiology Procedures"},{"location":"radiology/radiology-consults-radiology-procedures/#anticoagulation-for-ir-procedures","text":"Based on 2019 SIR Consensus Guidelines.

The differential for \u201cnoncaseating granulomas\u201d is extensive, including lymphoma and fungal infections. Not required for pts w/ asymptomatic bilateral hilar adenopathy or Lofgren syndrome (fever, erythema nodosum, arthralgias, and bilateral hilar LAD) Management Most pts do not require therapy: monitor symptoms, CXR, PFTs at 3-6 month intervals Indications for treatment: progressive disease or severe disease at presentation Mainstay of treatment is oral steroids: Dosing usually 0.3-0.6 mg/kg daily for 4-6 weeks If only symptoms is cough, could consider inhaled glucocorticoids If unresponsive or unable to tolerate steroids may require alternative agents (MTX, AZA) Crystalline Arthropathies \u2013 Thomas Horton Gout Presentation Red, hot, swollen joint (classically affects 1 st metatarsal phalangeal joint [podagra]) May progress to involve ankles, knees, elbows, and small joints of hand if untreated Flares may also become polyarticular over time Gout is diagnosed with combination of clinical presentation and arthrocentesis results Lifestyle factors: Protective: Low fat dairy, hydration, weight loss, smoking cessation Promoting: Meat, seafood, alcohol, high fructose corn syrup, medications that lead to hyperuricemia (ex: thiazides) Evaluation Synovial Fluid Analysis: Cell count and differential: WBC 20,000-100,000, > 50% neutrophils Order gram stain/culture (It is possible to have septic arthritis and gout) Examination for crystals under polarizing light microscopy: (order \u201cSynovial Fluid Eval\u201d so the lab knows to look for crystals) Monosodium urate crystals: needle-shaped and negatively birefringent and appear yellow when parallel to the polarizer Imaging: generally unnecessary MSK ultrasound: \"Double contour sign\" (hyperechoic band = urate crystals deposits) Radiographs: Punched out erosions or lytic areas with overhanging edges Dual energy CT scan: gout crystal aggregates appear green. Not routinely necessary; Do not order without rheumatology consult Management Acute: Do not discontinue allopurinol during an acute gout attack NSAIDs (if not contraindicated): Short course (2-5 days) at full anti-inflammatory dose: ibuprofen 800 mg TID, indomethacin 50 mg TID, naproxen 500 mg BID Colchicine (avoid if GFR \\<10 mL/min. Dose reduce by 50% if GFR \\<50 mL/min) Best if used within the first 36 hours of an attack. Much less effective if started later. Dosing: 1.2 mg then 0.6 mg one hour later, then 0.6 mg daily until clinical improvement Note drug interactions that may require dose adjustment of colchicine: Statins, diltiazem, fluconazole, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, clarithromycin, etc. Steroids: Ideally intra-articular if single joint affected and infection has been ruled out Oral prednisone, dose 0.5mg/kg/day until clinical improvement then taper over 7-14 days Anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist): 100mg once daily for three days (or QOD for CrCl \\<30). Requires rheumatology consult. For patients with contraindications to all other treatments Chronic: Urate Lowering Therapy (ULT) Indications: Strong: >2 attacks/year, one or more subcutaneous tophi, radiologic changes. Conditional: CKD 3 or worse, urolithiasis, serum urate >9 Goal serum urate: \\<6.0 mg/dL, or \\<5.0 mg/dL in patients with tophi ULT can precipitate an acute gout flare and should always be started with low-dose NSAIDs, colchicine (0.6 mg) or prednisone (5 mg daily or QOD) Prophylaxis should be continued for at least 6 months until uric acid is at goal and tophi have resolved Allopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor): Start low at 100 mg per day (sometimes even 50mg daily in those with advanced CKD) and increase as needed for target uric acid \\<6 (most patients will need 400-800 mg daily) Adjust dose monthly (3-4 weeks). In kidney dysfunction go slower. Titration of allopurinol \u2193 both the risk of acute gout attacks and DRESS syndrome Genetic testing (HLA-B*5801) recommended prior to starting for pts of Asian and African descent given \u2191 incidence of allopurinol hypersensitivity if + positive allele Febuxostat: alternative xanthine oxidase inhibitor that is metabolized by the liver for pts at risk for DRESS or SJS related to allopurinol. Black box warning for \u2191 cardiovascular risk; more expensive than allopurinol Consider Rheumatology consult for patients with refractory serum urate levels >6.0 on XOI Additional pearls There is a microscope in the rheumatology clinic at VUMC (TVC 2); You can page the rheumatology fellow and they are happy to help you use it Uric acid level is often normal during acute gout flare Shifts in uric acid may be the trigger of the flare: Diuresis, dietary changes, hospital stays Eliminating uric acid from the diet only reduces uric acid by ~1 mg/dL. Urate lowering therapy will be needed in most patients even if diet changed VA specific guidance: Colchicine is non-formulary but is easily approved For steroid intra-articular injections triamcinolone is the formulary option Pseudogout- Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease (CPPD) Presentation Red, hot, swollen joint usually in the wrists, knees, or MCP joints Cannot distinguish from gout based on clinical features alone. Like gout, diagnosis is based on exam and arthrocentesis More prevalent in the elderly populations Evaluation Synovial Fluid: Cell count and differential: WBC 20,000 to 100,000, >50% neutrophils Order gram stain/culture (It is possible to have septic arthritis and CPPD) Examination for crystals under polarizing light microscopy CPPD crystals: rhomboid-shaped, weakly positively birefringent and appear blue when parallel to the polarizer Imaging: XR: chondrocalcinosis (thin calcified line present in fibrocartilage) in the joint space (easiest to see in knee and wrists) Management Typically follows the same treatment used for acute gout attacks (see above, little evidence) Some patients may develop Chronic CPP Crystal Inflammatory Arthritis. Resembles RA in presentation Treatment base on symptoms and ranges from NSAIDs (1 st line) to > Colchicine, HCQ, and steroids. Can also use anakinra in acute > cases, with consult to rheumatology Additional Information CPPD can be associated with other disorders: hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia Consider further workup for these conditions, especially in a > younger patient.

Loxocelism is the medical manifestation of the brown recluse spider bite Venom contains insecticidal toxins, metalloproteases, and phospholipases Presentation \u00b6 Bites are most common on the upper arm, thorax, or inner thigh Local signs: Sometimes painless, but can cause burning sensation with two small cutaneous puncture marks with surrounding erythema. Pain can increase over the first 8 hours Usually appears as a red plaque or papule with central pallor and can sometimes present with vesiculation Usually self-resolves in 1 week Skin necrosis: In some, skin lesion can progress to necrosis overall several days An eschar will form that eventually ulcerates Usually will heal over several weeks to months Systemic signs: The degree of systemic effects does not correlate with the appearance of the bite Symptoms may develop over several days, and include nausea, vomiting, fever, rhabdomyolysis, malaise, acute hemolytic anemia, significant swelling from head/neck bites that can compromise the airway, DIC and renal failure Evaluation \u00b6 Presumptive diagnosis is based clinical presentation of the bite/wound DDx includes vasculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, cellulitis, or other arthropod bites Definitive diagnosis is based upon observing a spider bite in combination identification by an entomologist. There is an assay for Loxoceles venom, but it is not commercially available Patients with local symptoms do not need any further workup Patient with any systemic symptoms require lab evaluation for more serious disease: CBC, UA to eval for blood, CMP, CK If anemia: Type and Screen, peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, LDH, haptoglobin, coags to evaluate for hemolysis or DIC Management \u00b6 Local signs: Wound care (soap/water, elevation) Pain management Tetanus vaccine/prophylaxis if indicated Antibiotics only if signs of concurrent cellulitis Skin necrosis: Symptomatic and supportive care Surgical intervention can worsen cosmetic outcomes and is rarely indicated in the acute care setting. Skin grafting is occasionally needed for a very large ulcerative wound that is not healing.

This is a goal completion date, and this is a project of the US Government. CPRS skills are likely to be useful for a good while yet. Shortcuts \u00b6 CPRS has a rather staggering amount of keyboard shortcuts. The full list is available in this pdf . Task management \u00b6 One of the beautiful and awful things about CPRS is that it is self-contained. It does not interface with the outside world - no push notifications, no easy way to check things on your phone. Within its walled garden, it is also not easy to figure out what has been done and what needs doing. There are a few approaches to task management more-or-less built into CPRS. Tracker Reminder Notes \u00b6 One of the available note types is called \"Tracker Reminder.\" These are unsignable notes (try to sign one and it will fail), that remain in your inbox until deleted. They are a great way to prechart, and you can use them to make notes to yourself about whatever. No one else, including your preceptor, can see what's in them (maybe there's some way for some admin to introspect them, but I haven't heard of anyone who both knows how to do this and cares to look at your personal scribblings). I used to also use them as a general to-do list, and I know some residents live by them throughout training. I don't use them as a catch-all anymore (instead preferring Ticklers, outlined below), and now essentially only use them for pre-charting. In your inbox, all you can see is the patient for whom you have a Tracker Reminder, and the note title (\"UNSIGNED Tracker Reminder\") - there is no good way to differentiate between a precharted note, a to-do item, or anything else you may have written. CPRS is very slow, so clicking into each Tracker Reminder to see what's in there is much too expensive in terms of time. Ticklers \u00b6 Yes, self-assigned alerts in CPRS are called \"Ticklers.\" Because \"Alerts\" is not nearly descriptive enough. To set up Ticklers for yourself, get into a new note or make an addendum. (shout out to Paige, RN extraordinaire, for showing me her approach - it's A-OK to make an addendum with the content of only \"setting alert\") Click \"Templates\" on the bottom left. The first \"Shared Template\" should have the word \"Tickler.\" Double-click it, and it will open up a simple dialogue that asks you when you want to be alerted, and any text you would like within the alert. Then, when the time comes for that alert, it will show up in your universal CPRS inbox. When you click into it, it will show you the text you entered, and give you three options - copy the text of the alert to the clipboard, renew the alert, or close it out. One advantage to this approach over a huge list of Tracker Reminder notes is that your inbox does not become nearly as cluttered, and you can tell more easily what is time-sensitive. I also prefer it over some third-party solution, such as a OneNote page, Word doc, or Excel sheet (all HIPAA-compliant if using your institutional OneDrive account), because all of my VA work and data lives in a single system, so I don't have something else to (forget to) check. Leave-one-behind alert method \u00b6 The most common scenario: see a patient, order some studies. Study results roll in, you need to discuss next steps with the patient. Something is still processing, and/or you don't have time right now to have a phone call. Instead of leaving 6 or 7 alerts for the same person cluttering your inbox, remove all but one (highlight the alerts you want to get rid of and click \"Remove\"). That lone remaining alert functions as a reminder. When the stars align, click into that alert, go through all the recent results, and communicate however makes sense for the situation. Remote Access QoL \u00b6 Text expansion \u00b6 One of the best categories of quality-of-life improvements you can make for using CPRS remotely is text expansion/macros. On Windows, PhraseExpress is great. On Mac, aText is also great. Set up an expansion to [enter your passcode (123456) and hit \"Enter\"]. I have it set to ,c . (I have ,e mapped to my Epic password). This saves so much time and hassle. For example, to sign a note, I hit Ctrl+Shift+g to open the \"Sign Note\" dialog (this is a built-in CPRS shortcut), then I tap ,c , and the note is signed. Takes far less than a second, fingers stay close to home row. The VA made their own tool to do this, called \"CPRSBooster\" (it's somewhere under the Star folder on every desktop). It works. The main utility of CPRSBooster is to give you ideas for other text expansions you could set up, such as your nurse's name for tagging on notes. VistA \u00b6 VistA is the (rather insane) software and database system that undergirds CPRS. I get the sense that the deepest magicks rest in VistA, waiting for the intrepid explorer, seeking a grail filled with automated data extraction and sane clinical workflows. The documentation is scattered. This is one of the official sources. I've only taken a cursory look, but it seems less technical and mostly snarky. There's also a wiki devoted to VistA, though it is not restricted to the official USGovt version (since the software is federally mandated to be open source, it has been forked and developed in several countries worldwide). If you have been inducted into the cult of VistA, and need an acolyte, let me know.
